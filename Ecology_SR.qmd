::: {.callout-tip title="TL;DR"}
*Reviews in ecology often take short-cuts in the review process - the effect this has on the risk of bias is unknown and could be quite severe. A recent paper showed (in health) that some short-cuts can be carried out with minimal effect on the review. Many ecological reviews make short-cuts that can actually increase the risk of bias.*
:::

This post was inspired by the recent [ESHackathon](https://www.eshackathon.org/events/2023-12-newcastle.html) event hosted by the [Innovation Observitory](https://www.io.nihr.ac.uk/) at Newcastle University where one of the projects was to update [PredicTER](https://predicter.github.io/) so that we can predict the potential time saving of different common short-cuts used in rapid reviews.

## Rapid reviews

There is a clear demand from policy-makers for rapid evidence synthesis. "Rapid Reviews" are a type of systematic review where one or more of the review processes are simplified, sped-up (through, for example, AI tools to assist screening) or completely omitted. There is not a unified definition of what a "Rapid Review" is, and authors tend to take different "short-cuts" depending on resource constraints or the knowledge/experience of the review team.

A paper published in Research Synthesis Methods, [Haby et al. (2023)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jrsm.1664) addresses this heterogeneity in short-cuts used for Rapid Review and assess where possible the evidence about the risk of bias associated with each.

[Haby et al. (2023)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jrsm.1664) provide a really useful guide to what short-cuts one can take in a Rapid Review. Their Table 2 (recreated below) lists each commonly used short-cut and the potential impact on the risk of bias.

### What does this mean for ecological reviews?

In ecology authors of reviews (sometimes incorrectly labelled systematic reviews or meta-analysis) often take short-cuts such as only searching a single source, not assessing risk of bias or using only single reviewers (see this great paper by [Haddaway et al. 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-020-01295-x) for a list of common problems with reviews and how to fix them).

What strikes me from [Haby et al. (2023)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jrsm.1664) is that most of the short-cuts authors take in ecology are those that increase the risk of bias. For example, it is common to see a statement such as this in ecological reviews:

"We conducted a search of the ISI Web of Science database\* on \[DATE\], using the following key words..."

::: {#NotaDatabase .callout-important}
## \*WOS is NOT a database

It is important to note that the Web Of Science platform is not a database, but rather a collection of databases. Each institution might have different subscriptions. Thus it is important that review authors list the databases that their institution has access to.

[![](images/WoS.png){fig-align="center"}](https://x.com/nealhaddaway/status/1093810798793814016?s=20)
:::

Searching a single source increases the risk of bias because not all journals are indexed on each platform. A quick look at the results from two sources will show you that there are always (sometimes quite large) differences between the results of a search. For example, searching for peer-reviewed articles on Lake spawning Brown Trout in Web of Science ([WOS](https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/summary/61932120-b894-463a-8bce-f40e84abd8f6-c1c4b68a/relevance/1)) versus searching in [Lens.org](https://link.lens.org/xwHHibSWKGj) leads to a total of 1385 records, but only 69 of these are duplicated across sources. If we only used WOS there is a risk that we might miss important evidence.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#https://github.com/ESHackathon/CiteSource
#remotes::install_github("ESHackathon/CiteSource")
library(CiteSource)
#Import citation files from a folder
citation_files <- list.files(path = file.path("data"), full.names = TRUE)

citations <- read_citations(citation_files,
                            cite_sources = c("lens.org", "WOS"),verbose = FALSE)
```

```{r,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Comparision of two databases (WOS & lens.org) when searching for ecological evidence"}
#Deduplicate citations. 
unique_citations <- dedup_citations(citations)

#Count number of unique and non-unique citations from different sources  
n_unique <- count_unique(unique_citations)

#For each unique citation, determine which sources were present
source_comparison <- compare_sources(unique_citations, comp_type = "sources")

#Generate source comparison heatmap
plot_source_overlap_heatmap(source_comparison)
```

I also found it interesting that dropping grey literature from a review can have minimal effect (although it is noted that the effect size might be overestimated) on the risk of bias. I wonder if grey literature is more important in ecology than in health? In ecology we have a large number of commissioned reports or "unpublished" reports (technical reports from NGOs etc. might be "unpublished" but still widely available on websites) that are important sources of evidence. For example, in a systematic review by [Bernes et al.(2015)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9) grey literature made up over 20% of the studies included in the synthesis. This represents a large proportion of the evidence-base in this particular case.  

## Conclusion

Ecological reviews often take short-cuts that increase the risk of bias in the reported findings - it is important that we recognise this risk and highlight it to stakeholders and policy makers.
