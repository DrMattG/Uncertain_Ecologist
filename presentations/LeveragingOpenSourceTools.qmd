## What is Evidence Synthesis Technology?

-   “Technology is the collection of techniques, skills, methods, and processes…”

-   Depends on when you ask – SR was a novel technology once!

-   Tools to support evidence synthesis – to overcome challenges

::: {style="color:#cc0000"}
## What types of technology {background-image="images/Robot.png"}

-   Computer assistance – technology-assisted reviews

-   Capacity development / training

-   Better / easier record keeping

-   Increased efficiency / transparency / rigour

-   Automation – technology-driven reviews
:::

## 

Many and increasing tools available to help in systematic review

-   But...Often pay-walled…

    …or not supported long-term

-   A lot of redundancy

-   Very limited interoperability

-   Tools frequently not validated (or validated by the developers)

## Vienna Principles

[Principles of the International Collaboration for the Automation of Systematic Reviews (ICASR). Syst Rev 7, 77 (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13643-018-0740-7)

-   Ability to work with different tools at different stages

-   Tools should be interoperable

-   Collaboration needed to cover all synthesis stages

-   Code should be Open Source

-   Standardised validation

## What is the ESHackathon?

### Mission

The ESH aims to bring together interested researchers, practitioners and coders to discuss and develop new Open Source technologies for ES applications

## Origin

-   ESH started as an open software development event in 2018
-   ESH has evolved into a conference, training courses and hackathons
