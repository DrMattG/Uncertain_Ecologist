<p>I have been playing around with the <a href="https://docs.ropensci.org/openalexR/index.html">OpenAlexR</a> package which interfaces with the <a href="https://openalex.org/">OpenAlex API</a>. This allows you to get bibliographic information about publications, authors, institutions, sources, funders, publishers, topics and concepts.</p>
<p>Here I first look at the proportion of open publications published by <a href="www.nina.no">NINA</a> over time.</p>
<p>First we need to look for the Institution ID.</p>

<p>The “topic” for each record is a description of the subject matter of the publication determined by using a large language model. The example from the <a href="https://help.openalex.org/how-it-works/topics">OpenAlex topics page</a> is:</p>
<p><strong>Example Topic</strong>: “Artificial Intelligence in Medicine” <strong>Domain</strong>: “Health Sciences” <strong>Field</strong>: “Medicine” <strong>Subfield</strong>: “Health Informatics”</p>
<p>Each topic is made up of a subfield, a field and a domain. The model scores each documents topics, with the highest topic score being considered the “primary” topic.</p>
