<h2>Building an Academic CV ShinyDashboard</h2>
<p>Inspired by Prof. Mark Reed’s infographic CV (see: <a href="https://www.fasttrackimpact.com/post/2019/06/06/how-to-make-an-infographic-cv-featuring-impact-that-you-could-actually-submit-with-your-n" class="uri">https://www.fasttrackimpact.com/post/2019/06/06/how-to-make-an-infographic-cv-featuring-impact-that-you-could-actually-submit-with-your-n</a>) I decided to see if I could make a ShinyDashboard version. My first attempt can be found at: <a href="https://drmatt.shinyapps.io/AcademicCVShinyDashboard/" class="uri">https://drmatt.shinyapps.io/AcademicCVShinyDashboard/</a></p>
<p>It still needs a lot of work to make it more visually appealling, but I think its a good starting point.</p>
