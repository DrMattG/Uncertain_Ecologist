*Embark on an innovative journey with ESHackathon* *– where our workshops promote inclusive dynamic spaces for collaboration in evidence synthesis*.

Originating as an open software development event in 2018, ESHackathon has evolved into a conference, training courses and hackathons, uniting diverse talents to tackle complex challenges in identifying and summarising evidence.

### **Why is Technology Vital for Evidence Synthesis?**

In a world of constantly expanding literature, ESTech revolutionises the way we synthesise the literature. Through text analysis, machine learning, and collaborative coding, we automate tasks, cut costs, and enhance global accessibility, making rigorous evidence synthesis efficient.

### **Hackathon Highlights:**

-   <div>

    Diverse Participation: All are welcome - coders, health researchers, environmental scientists, social scientists, statisticians and more!

    </div>

-   <div>

    Problem-Solving: It's not just for programmers! Combine technology and evidence synthesis expertise to develop novel frameworks and tackle fundamental evidence synthesis challenges.

### **ESHackathon Project Highlights**

Participants in ESH have produced 11 fully functional tools, many of which have non-coding user interfaces. Tools include:

-   [citationchaser](https://www.eshackathon.org/software/citationchaser.html) - conducts forward and backward citation chasing for systematic searching

-   [EviAtlas](https://www.eshackathon.org/software/eviatlas.html) - creates interactive visualisations of geographical evidence map data

-   [robvis](https://www.eshackathon.org/software/robvis.html) - visualises risk of bias assessments

-   [metafor::reports](https://www.eshackathon.org/software/metafor-reports.html) - produces methods and results text based on meta-analytic model inputs

-   [sysrevdata](https://www.eshackathon.org/software/sysrevdata.html) - converts between evidence synthesis database formats (long, wide, condensed)

-   [PRISMA2020](https://www.eshackathon.org/software/PRISMA2020.html) - produces PRISMA-compliant flow diagrams (\>6000 monthly users)

-   [ROSESflowchart](http://rosesflowchart) - produces ROSES-compliant flow diagrams

-   [bibfix](https://www.eshackathon.org/software/bibfix.html) - corrects and compiles bibliographic files

-   [metadat](https://www.eshackathon.org/software/metadat.html) - an R repository of meta-analytic datasets

-   [PredicTER](https://www.eshackathon.org/software/predicter.html) - estimates the time requirement for evidence synthesis projects
