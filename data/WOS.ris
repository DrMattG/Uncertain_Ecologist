AB  - The movement of 34 large (39-73 cm standard length) brown trout Salmo trutta was monitored using radio telemetry for up to 74 days in Brumunda, a small Norwegian river (mean annual discharge 3(.)3m(3) s(-1)) flowing into the large Lake Mjosa. The maximum range of movement in the river was 20km. No clear relationships existed between individual movement and water discharge, temperature and barometric pressure. Brown trout migrated at all levels of water discharge. At low discharge (<2m(3) s(-1)) movements were nocturnal. A weir 5(.)3 km from the outlet restricted ascending brown trout at low (c. 6degrees C), but not at high (c. 8degrees C) water temperatures. Spawning occurred in September to October and tagged individuals spent 2-51 days at the spawning sites. Mean migration speed from tagging to when the fish reached the spawning area, and from when they left the spawning areas and reached the lake was 1(.)0 and 2(.)3 km day(-1), respectively. All tagged brown trout that survived spawning returned to the lake after spawning. (C) 2004 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.

AB  - The post-spawning movements and distribution of 15 brown trout (Salmo trutta Linnaeus 1758) and 21 rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss Richardson, 1836) were monitored weekly between August 1996 and March 1997 in the hydro-electric reservoir, Lake Otamangakau, New Zealand, using radio-telemetry. The most frequently used areas were the vicinity of the main inflow and the channel running through the main body of the lake. After spawning, brown trout regained rapidly their usual habitat. Rainbow trout were using the inlet intensively before recolonising the main channel of the lake. Brown trout made greater use of the weedy parts of the lake and littoral margins, had a more confined home range, and were less mobile than rainbow trout. Rainbow trout occupied the main body of the lake by day, and moved nearer the surface, and closer to the margins, at night. High lake levels allowed brown trout to exploit wetland margins of the lake.

AB  - Spawning runs of brown trout Salmo trutta L., and rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss Walbaum, were compared in three tributaries of two lakes for timing, numbers and redd characteristics. Redd characteristics for the two species in four other streams were examined. No significant differences in redd characteristics between the two species were observed, but in all lake tributaries the possibilities of superimposition of spring spawning rainbow trout on redds of brown trout were examined. A common feature was the high ratio of numbers of spawners to the area of preferred spawning gravel, and it was concluded that in the lake tributaries, superimposition resulted in increased mortality of brown trout eggs, and in one case elimination of the brown trout population. Management possibilities for control of the species proportions in comparable situations are discussed.

AB  - The persistence of the initial genetic structure despite later stocking with foreign conspecifics is influenced by several factors, leading to different levels of introgression. Stream spawning has been assumed to be the prevailing recruitment strategy of brown trout (Salmo trutta L.). However, in lakes with limited stream spawning habitat, but still with high natural recruitment, lake spawning has been proposed. Using fourteen microsatellites, we assessed the genetic structure in a small allopatric brown trout population in the Lake Skavatn, located on the Hardangervidda mountain plateau, Norway. A total of 265 brown trout were obtained from the lake itself, the outlet stream, two tributaries, a littoral sample from a presumed lake spawning site, a suggested stocking source, and a lake sample from 1967, representing the initial lake population. The six Skavatn samples were best represented by three genetic components, showing a shift from the initial population, but with no genetic signal from the suggested stocking source. The littoral sample had the largest similarity to the initial lake population, possibly indicating the importance of lake spawning in a system where streams offer unpredictable spawning and rearing conditions. Due to large annual variations in recruitment contributions from the different spawning and rearing locations, the genetic structure of the lake population probably vary over time.

AB  - Seepage water through a lake bottom and the layering of tight and high-permeable layers in the aquifer produce groundwater under greater pressure than the water column of the lake. This results in under-water springs and seepages. When spawning substrata were available, there was a spatial correlation between the degree of groundwater influx and the redd density of brown trout Salmo trutta. In high density spawning areas with > 100 observed redds ha(-1) the mean seepage water influx during spring was c. 1200 ml m min(-1) compared to a mean flux of 113 ml m(-2) min(-1) in low density spawning areas with 5-10 redds ha(-1).

AB  - Reproductive interaction between sympatric lampreys and salmonids was studied. The superimposition of brown trout Salmo trutta redds by spring-spawning river lamprey Lampetra fluviatilis and brook lamprey Lampetra planeri was examined in a small lowland stream of western Lithuania. A high superimposition rate of S. trutta redds by both L. fluviatilis (up to 83%) and L. planeri (up to 48%) was found, when the spawning intensity of Lampetra spp. was high. The occurrence of this phenomenon is the result of the overlap in the spawning habitat preferences at the reach-scale and at the microhabitat scale for the three species. One of the main requirements for Lampetra spp. spawning site selection was the negative streambed slope, an essential trait of the pool-riffle transitional zone. The structure of the salmonid redd created a considerable negative microhabitat slope suitable for Lampetra spp. spawning, which put the redds under a higher susceptibility to be superimposed. The timing of Lampetra spp. spawning overlapped closely with the emergence of S. trutta fry, suggesting a probable ecological effect of superimposition on S. trutta in the pre-emergent and emerging stages.

AB  - Conservation of species should be based on knowledge of effective population sizes and understanding of how breeding tactics and selection of recruitment habitats lead to genetic structuring. In the stream-spawning and genetically diverse brown trout, spawning and rearing areas may be restricted source habitats. Spatio-temporal genetic variability patterns were studied in brown trout occupying three lakes characterized by restricted stream habitat but high recruitment levels. This suggested non-typical lake-spawning, potentially representing additional spatio-temporal genetic variation in continuous habitats. Three years of sampling documented presence of young-of-the-year cohorts in littoral lake areas with groundwater inflow, confirming lake-spawning trout in all three lakes. Nine microsatellite markers assayed across 901 young-of-the-year individuals indicated overall substantial genetic differentiation in space and time. Nested gene diversity analyses revealed highly significant (<= P = 0.002) differentiation on all hierarchical levels, represented by regional lakes (F-LT = 0.281), stream vs. lake habitat within regional lakes (F-HL = 0.045), sample site within habitats (F-SH = 0.010), and cohorts within sample sites (F-CS = 0.016). Genetic structuring was, however, different among lakes. It was more pronounced in a natural lake, which exhibited temporally stable structuring both between two lake-spawning populations and between lake- and stream spawners. Hence, it is demonstrated that lake-spawning brown trout form genetically distinct populations and may significantly contribute to genetic diversity. In another lake, differentiation was substantial between stream- and lake-spawning populations but not within habitat. In the third lake, there was less apparent spatial or temporal genetic structuring. Calculation of effective population sizes suggested small spawning populations in general, both within streams and lakes, and indicates that the presence of lake-spawning populations tended to reduce genetic drift in the total (meta-) population of the lake.

AB  - 1. The lacustrine brown trout (Salmo trutta) is endangered and of high conservation importance. In the only spawning habitat of the population in the Bavarian Lake Walchensee, the River Obernach, a substantial decrease in spawning runs has been reported. In this study, the present ecological state of the spawning stream was analysed with the objective of identifying life-stage specific limitations to successful recruitment attributable to deficiencies in (i) spawning migration, (ii) spawning habitat quality, and (iii) habitat quality for juveniles. 2. Structural stream analysis showed that discharge and several migration barriers-particularly near the river outlet into the lake-prevent successful spawning migrations at normal water levels. Migration barriers are probably the main limiting factor for reproduction of lacustrine brown trout, whereas structural variability of the Obernach meets the habitat requirements of both spawners and juveniles. 3. Spawning site quality was suitable for trout, as indicated by stream substratum texture and high exchange rates between free-flowing water and the interstitial zone in physico-chemical parameters (redox potential, dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature and conductivity). 4. Analyses of fish community structure revealed dominance of lithophilic species, in particular of riverine brown trout (Salmo trutta). Its density and intact demographic population structure suggest that spawning and juvenile habitat quality for salmonids is not limiting. Recapture of stocked lacustrine trout juveniles also indicates habitat suitability for the juvenile stage. 5. In conclusion, the results show that the methodology used in this study is suitable for the identification of life-stage specific habitat deficiencies in lacustrine brown trout and other fish species. Availability of habitat data throughout the species' distribution range is a first crucial step for the development of an effective recovery plan. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Rivers draining into (Lake) Inarijarvi, northern Finland, sustain a number of lake-run brown trout, Salmo trutta, populations but, as with most lake-run S. trutta systems, the level of population genetic structuring among populations is unknown. To address this and to assist fish stock management in the region, the population genetic structure of S. trutta collected from 28 sampling sites in rivers flowing into Inarijarvi was studied using 13 microsatellite loci. Populations were clustered into three separate groups, largely corresponding to geographic regions, with between-region F-ST values ranging from 0 center dot 11 to 0 center dot 16. The significant differentiation observed between most populations within each region also implies that individual populations should be recognized as separate management units and actions to improve, and subsequently maintain, conditions for natural spawning should be prioritized. The results of this study further indicate that the trout from each of these regions may have different biological characteristics, such as local-lake feeding behaviour among the western populations and strong isolation among the northern stocks. As a consequence, further research is warranted to better understand the level of ecological uniqueness of lake-run S. trutta populations.

AB  - Repeated liming of Hovvatn during the 1981-1995 period assured successful reintroduction of lake spawning brown trout, Salmo trutta. Poor natural recruitment to the population was associated with low survival during early life stages (before hatching) as shown by the 0.5, 3.5, 0.9 and 1.0% of live embryos found in natural redds during the 1992-1995 period, respectively. The low survival was most likely caused by the combination of shallow spawning areas (<2.0 m) and acidic runoff (pH 4.0-4.8) which overlayed the limed part of the water body during the ice covered period. It is therefore concluded that this type of episodic acidification poses a major threat to lake spawning salmonids, and that it can retard or inhibit biotic recovery towards preacidified conditions expected as a result of liming. Addition of limestone gravel (8-32 mm) onto spawning grounds was an efficient alternative liming strategy as 33-36% live embryos were found in this substrate. Conversely, the trout actively avoided additions of shellsand, a behaviour most likely caused by the small particle size of shellsand (3-7 mm) relative to natural spawning gravel.

AB  - Brown trout (Salmo trutta) are extensively harvested and its habitat highly influenced by human encroachments. Using a 40-year time series of mark recapture data we estimate vital rates for a piscivorous trout population. This population spawns upstream of a waterfall, which historically acted as a migration barrier for smaller trout. In 1966, the waterfall was dammed and a fish ladder constructed. All fish ascending the fish ladder were individually tagged and measured for a variety of traits. The fish ladder overall favoured access to upstream spawning areas for middle-sized trout, resulting in stabilizing selection acting on size at spawning. Over time, natural and fishing mortality have varied, with fishing mortality generally decreasing and natural mortality increasing. The average and, particularly, variance in size-at-first-spawning, and growth rates during the first years of lake residence have all decreased over the 1966-2003 period. These changes are all consistent with a shift from directional to stabilizing selection on age and size at spawning. Estimated rates of phenotypic change are relatively high, in particular for size at first spawning, adding further support for the growing notion that human interference may lead to rapid life-history trait evolution.

AB  - In this study, multiple molecular markers [genotyping of 12 nuclear microsatellite loci and the protein-coding gene ldh-c1* plus sequencing of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region] were employed to investigate the genetic structure of the two trout forms, Salmo cettii and Salmo fibreni, inhabiting Lake Posta Fibreno, central Italy. The two forms were found to share a unique mtDNA haplotype, belonging to a widespread Mediterranean haplogroup (AD). Bayesian clustering analyses showed that these two forms correspond to well-defined autochthonous gene pools. Genetic introgression between the two gene pools, however, was observed, whose frequency appears to correlate with the environmental features of the spawning sites. The interplay of selection for the spawning sites, philopatry and natural selection can be argued to maintain genetic differentiation despite the lack of complete reproductive isolation.

AB  - Molecular marker studies reported here, involving allozymes, mitochondrial DNA and microsatellites, demonstrate that ferox brown trout Salmo trutta in Lochs Awe and Laggan, Scotland, are reproductively isolated and genetically distinct from co-occurring brown trout. Ferox were shown to spawn primarily, and possibly solely, in a single large river in each lake system making them particularly vulnerable to environmental changes. Although a low level of introgression seems to have occurred with sympatric brown trout, possibly as a result of human-induced habitat alterations and stocking, ferox trout in these two lakes meet the requirements for classification as a distinct biological, phylogenetic and morphological species. It is proposed that the scientific name Salmo ferox Jardine, 1835, as already applied to Lough Melvin (Ireland) ferox, should be extended to Awe and Laggan ferox.

AB  - Brown trout, Salmo trutta L., spawning sites were constructed by creating areas of artificial upwelling water, 252 +/- 37 mL m(-2) min(-1) (95% CL), through appropriately sized spawning gravel substrate in 3 m(2) vessels buried in the bottom of a 150-m(2) pond. Natural spawning occurred in the vessels during autumn 2001-2004, with hatching and alevin swim up the following spring. In areas of upwelling, egg survival was 85-95%, while no live eggs were observed in areas without upwelling. In areas with upwelling, the maximum density of live eggs at the eyed stage was 570-1510 eggs m(-2). In spring 2004 and 2005, the density of alevins was estimated at 322 (+/- 187) m(-2) and 567 (+/- 217) m(-2), respectively, in areas with upwelling water, compared with 35.2 +/- 25.4 m(-2) in areas without upwelling water in 2004.

AB  - Inlet and outlet spawners of rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss were tagged in Lake Huechulafquen in the 1990 spawning season. In the fishing season, 8.3% and 10.0% of the spent trout tagged from the inlet and oulet, respectively, were recaptured in the lake by sport anglers. This demonstrated that outlet spent adults also migrated in the lake as well as inlet spawners. The monthly distribution of the tag-recovery locations showed that the spent adults dispersed throughout the lake one month after the spawning season, and they started migrating toward their spawning streams three months before the next spawning. A few tags from the inlet were also recovered 25 km downstream from the lake. In the 1991 spawning season, 8.6% and 10.0% repeat homing to the inlet and outlet, respectively, were observed. A few stray homers were observed, but most repeat spawners returned to their home spawning streams.

AB  - By use of acoustic telemetry, the present study showed that both riverine anadromous brown trout (sea trout) Salmo trutta and Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus in a north Norwegian river descended the river within the first 4 months after spawning in late September and spent long parts of the remaining winter period in the estuary and also possibly partly in salt water. This contradicts the general assumption, based on studies of lake-dwelling populations, that both species, and in particular S. alpinus, overwinter and spend 9-11 months in fresh water at northern latitudes and the rest of the year in salt water.

AB  - Two populations of anadromous Arctic char Saivelinus alpinus at the same latitude (67-degrees-N) in Norway were studied from 1975 to 1989. River Beiarelva Arctic char stay for the entire freshwater portion of their lives in the main river in running water. The Saltdal Arctic char mainly spawn, and the young stay until smoltification, in a lake that drains to the River Saltdalselva. The river-dwelling Arctic char grow better and smoltify at a lower age and at a smaller size than the lake-dwelling fish. They also reach maturity at a lower age, but at the same size as the lake-dwelling Arctic char. In both rivers, Atlantic salmon Salmo salar and anadromous brown trout Salmo trutta are the predominant fish species. The study demonstrated that anadromous Arctic char may exist sympatrically with Atlantic salmon and brown trout in running water. In the watershed where a lake is available, most of the Arctic char stay in the lake in spite of the better growth and lower smolting age that they might attain in running water.

AB  - Salmonid introductions have been numerous during the last 60 years in high-elevation streams and lakes of the Hautes-Pyrenees region. Six salmonid species : brown trout (Salmo trutta L.), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss Walbaum), brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis Mitchill), arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus L.), lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush Walbaum), and splake (Salvelinus fontinalis x Salvelinus namaycush) have been introduced in these regions where originally no fish was present. Acclimatization was observed in many cases, but investigations revealed that few populations reproduce. Only lake species (lake trout and arctic chaw) reproduce in most lakes into which they were introduced. Adequate spawning conditions were the most important feature required for salmonid naturalisation. But in streams, interspecific competition with brown trout, the effects of angling, and severe winter conditions also interfered. The ecological effects of these introductions on the native brown trout species were very weak. Consequences were more important for amphibian populations, many of which declined dramatically. Salmonid introductions allowed the development of sport fishing in these high-elevation regions. From this point of view, they perfectly answered their aims. Broad knowledge on the whole Pyrenean mountain range is now required for a global management policy of introductions.

Contribution of Koayu, calculated using delta N-15 values of spawned Ayu eggs, was much greater than that of Ooayu in general, as previously reported. Ooayu spawned more eggs in the upper area of the spawning ground and did so late in the season. These results show the potential of isotopic approaches for identifying maternal life-history types of spawned eggs of migratory animals.

AB  - Brown trout Salmo trutta in the subalpine lake, circle dividevre Heimdalsvatn, showed large temporal variation in the rate of predation on the introduced minnow Phoxinus phoxinus population. Minnows were found in the stomachs of brown trout between 16 and 38cm L-T. Significantly greater predation was recorded shortly after ice break at the end of June 1999, with frequencies of 9 and 20% within the L-T classes 16-29.9 cm and greater than or equal to30 cm, respectively. Predation on minnows was only occasionally detected during July, August and September. The high level of predation coincided with minnow spawning, and lengths of consumed minnows were equal to those of sexually mature individuals. Accepting a causal link between minnow spawning, which lasted c. 3 weeks, and the contemporary high rate of predation, the estimated annual consumption of minnows by the brown trout population would be 138.kg wet mass. Although most of the annual consumption of minnows by brown trout (90%) occurred within a very short period (3 weeks); it accounted for a significant proportion (60%) of the annual loss in biomass of the sexually mature part of the population.

AB  - Brown trout (Salmo trutta Linnaeus 1758) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss Richardson 1836) populations in littoral zones of eight South Island, New Zealand alpine lakes were compared using gill and seine net sampling during summer. Lakes were selected to provide a matrix of lake level and water clarity variations and to assess how these variables influenced trout abundance (as reflected by catch rate), depth distribution, and size. Brown trout were small and in poor condition in three turbid lakes with shallow littoral zones and were scarce in one of these with a 14 m fluctuation. Although brown trout condition was generally higher in clear lakes, Lake Wanaka fish were an exception. Trout depth distribution was positively related to depth of the littoral zone. Brown trout were caught at most depths whereas rainbow trout showed variable depth preferences in different lakes. Rainbow trout catch rate, weight, and condition factor were unrelated to differences in depth of the littoral zone or lake level fluctuations, and it was concluded that spawning success and limnetic food supplies may be more important for this species. Spawning interactions may account for the different species composition between the stable clear Lake Wanaka, and the adjacent fluctuating clear Lake Hawea. Moderate and slow lake level fluctuations appear to have limited effects on trout in clear lakes, probably because trout are able to use deep littoral habitat and food supplies.

AB  - Many Norwegian rivers and lakes are regulated for hydropower, which affects freshwater ecosystems and anadromous fish species, such as sea trout (Salmo trutta). Lakes are an important feature of many anadromous river systems. However, there is limited knowledge on the importance of lakes as habitat for sea trout and how hydropower affects the behaviour of sea trout in lakes. To investigate this, we conducted an acoustic telemetry study. A total of 31 adult sea trout (532 +/- 93 mm total length) were captured by angling in river Aurlandselva, Norway, and tagged between July 20 and August 12, 2021. The tags were instrumented with accelerometer, temperature, and depth sensors, which provided information on the sea trout's presence and behaviour in lake Vassbygdevatnet. Our results indicate that there was a large prevalence of sea trout in the lake during the spawning migration, and that the sea trout were less active in the lake compared to the riverine habitats. An increase in activity of sea trout in the lake during autumn might indicate that sea trout spawn in the lake. However, the discharge from the high-head storage plant into the lake did not affect the depth use or activity of sea trout in the lake. Furthermore, the large prevalence of spawners in the lake during autumn will likely cause an underestimation of the size of the sea trout population in rivers with lakes during annual stock assessment. In conclusion, our results could not find evidence of a large impact of the discharge on the behaviour of sea trout in the lake.

AB  - From 1968-1984 (period I), a brown trout Salmo trutta population in a 70-ha oligotrophic lake in central Norway was exploited using larger mesh gill-nets selectively removing the larger fish. From 1985-1994 (period II), intermediate sized fish were removed using smaller-mesh sizes gill-nets. Fishing mortality and CPUE were correlated positively with effort and numbers of fish >3 years old for period II. The gill-net catchability was correlated negatively with spawner biomass and number of trout >3 years old. The significant positive correlation between natural mortality and stock biomass and spawning stock biomass indicated density-dependent mortality. The significant correlation between spawning stock and recruitment described by the Bicker model, indicated density-dependent recruitment of 1-year-old trout. The fishing regimes in the two periods affected the population dynamics and density differently. Selective removal of smaller fish permitted the larger fish to survive, and was beneficial in reducing Fish density and maintaining stocks at low levels, consequently, achieving the expected increase in fish growth rates.

AB  - 1, Unlike a neighbouring sea-trout population that showed strong density-dependent survival, a resident trout population (Salmo trutta L.) showed simple proportionate survival in the early life-stages. However, this persistent population fluctuated within narrow limits. Mature adults, especially during spawning, were the only possible life-stage left in which regulation might occur.
   2. An October census,just prior to spawning, was made at five sites (total area 300 m(2)) from 1965 to 1983. Gravel nests (redds) associated with females of known size were excavated outside these sites to obtain a power-function relationship between egg density per redd and female length (range 181-280 mm, n = 26). This relationship and the census data for females (range 186-284mm) were used to estimate egg densities in each year-class.
   3, The census data for the: early life-stages (0+, 1+, 2+ trout) confirmed proportionate survival with no evidence for density-dependent regulation. In contrast, the number of spawning females produced in each year-class was strongly density dependent on the initial number of females that laid eggs at the start of the year-class. Similarly, total egg production in each year-class was density dependent on initial egg density.
   4. Both relationships were well described by the Ricker and Beverton-Holt stock-recruitment models (P < 0.001) and the goodness-of-fit was similar for both models. This study is probably the first to provide clear evidence for fish population regulation in the adult, rather than the juvenile, stage.

AB  - Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) is generally considered an inferior piscivore compared to brown trout (Salmo trutta). However, we demonstrate that a recently described profundal spawning piscivore PP-morph of Arctic charr in a subarctic lake has evolved typical piscivore traits (i.e. large jaws, robust skulls), similar to the co-occurring brown trout but different from the sympatric littoral spawning omnivore LO-morph of Arctic charr. A few large-sized LO-morph, most large-sized PP-morph and trout constitute the piscivore guild, but they differed in prey fish selection. Of the fish-eating deep-water PP-morph, 52% had consumed charr, with a peak during the polar night period (68-80% in November-January). In contrast, the LO-morph and trout were mainly (similar to 90%) inter-specific piscivores eating stickleback. Consequently, the PP-morph was the main charr predator and started to feed on fish at a smaller size and took larger prey relative to their body length than the trout. Stable isotope (delta C-13, delta N-15) ratios reflect the dietary specialisations in the upper-water (LO-morph, trout) and the deep-water (PP-morph) environments, besides the piscivorous behaviour of the PP-morph and trout. The existence of a shallow-water piscivore (trout) may explain the origin of this PP-morph, taking benefit of underutilised resources of small-sized Arctic charr in the deep-water habitat.

AB  - Increased interest from waterway stakeholders and managers in controlling introduced fishes in selected situations, together with limited knowledge regarding effective means of doing so, makes the reporting of control projects in various environments important. This study reports the results of control trials on an introduced fish assemblage (Salmo trutta [brown trout], Perca fluviatilus [Eurasian perch], and Scardinius erythropthalmus [common rudd]) in a small lagoon in the lower North Island. The trials indicated that repeated netting was an effective means of suppressing introduced fish biomass and could potentially result in eradication if the lagoon was closed off to immigration from the adjacent lake. Increases in native fish density and diversity during the control trials indicated that the reduction in introduced fish biomass could have alleviated predation pressure on these species. In addition perch, and to a lesser degree rudd, completed regular spawning migrations into the lagoon from the lake during spring, providing opportunities for strategic control in the future.

AB  - This study was based on genotyping eight microsatellite loci of 463 brown trout, Salmo trutta L., sampled in nine differently sized tributaries in three areas on the eastern shore of Lake MjOsa, south-eastern Norway. The populations were genetically structured, and Mantel's test showed that genetic distance correlated positively with geographical distance. Temporal differentiation F-ST over a 2-year period was estimated in five streams and was non-significant after Bonferroni correction. Effective population size N-e was positively correlated with the habitat length available from the lake (0.3-22km) and negatively with the number of full sib pairs in the sample. There was no correlation between N-e and genetic diversity, and private alleles were recorded in three medium-sized streams, but not in the largest two. The importance of small spawning and nursery streams for the maintenance of genetic diversity of brown trout was demonstrated.

AB  - Animals often exhibit extensive flexibility in movement behaviours on a range of temporal and spatial scales in response to cues that reliably predict fitness outcomes. The annual timing of movements between distinct habitats can be crucial, particularly in seasonal environments with narrow ecological windows of opportunity. In polygamous species, sexual selection may further shape sex-specific phenology and movement behaviours. Here, we characterized seasonal, daily and diel movement patterns in adult brown trout, Salmo trutta, between a lake feeding habitat and two spawning streams in northwestern Ireland, using passive integrated transponder (PIT) telemetry. Antennae positioned at the inflow and outflow of the lake were used to monitor movements of 197 lake-tagged adults between lake and stream habitats. Across 2 years in both streams, movements were overwhelmingly nocturnal and exhibited distinct seasonality, with a peak in daily detections close to the winter solstice. In both streams, seasonal movement activity of males began and peaked before that of females (protandry). Daily detection probabilities for both sexes increased as the moon waned (decreasing lunar illumination) and as river depth increased, the latter being associated with reduced water clarity. These findings are consistent with fish favouring movement between fluvial and lacustrine habitats when light (both solar and lunar) or hydrological conditions decrease their exposure to visually oriented predators. The observed protandry also suggests a role for intrasexual male competition, whereby earlier male arrival could increase mating opportunities. (C) 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Non-native migratory salmonids ascend tributaries to spawn in all the Great Lakes. In Lake Ontario, these species include Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), coho salmon (O. kisutch), steelhead (O. mykiss), and brown trout (Salmo trutta). Although successful natural reproduction has been documented for many of these species, little research has been conducted on their spawning habitat. We examined the spawning habitat of these four species in the Salmon River, New York. Differences in fish size among the species were significantly correlated with spawning site selection. In the Salmon River, the larger species spawned in deeper areas with larger size substrate and made the largest redds. Discriminant function analysis correctly classified redds by species 64-100% of the time. The size of substrate materials below Lighthouse Hill Dam is within the preferred ranges for spawning for these four species indicating that river armoring has not negatively impacted salmonid production. Intra-specific and inter-specific competition for spawning sites may influence redd site selection for smaller salmonids and could be an impediment for Atlantic salmon (S. salon) restoration.

AB  - Grayling Thymallus thymallus in Lake Aursjoen, Norway, showed a remarkably uniform growth pattern throughout life, whereas brown trout Salmo trutta showed far more variation. In addition, a narrower age-length interval of maturation was found in grayling. The restricted life history variation in grayling is discussed and it is suggested that all grayling of Lake Aursjoen experience similar environmental conditions as juveniles, which induces low phenotypic variation. In contrast the existence of several spawning populations, adapted to as many as 28 different tributaries, may have created large life history variation in Aursjoen trout. Logistic models revealed that both age and length had significant, simultaneous effects on the maturation of both species. Furthermore, the sexes of trout differed in maturation patterns, i.e. males matured earlier and at smaller sizes than female conspecifics, but no difference was found between the sexes of grayling. In addition, larger sex-specific growth differences were found in trout. An absence of early maturing males in grayling and their presence in trout is discussed as a possible explanation of the restricted life history variation found between sexes of grayling. Male grayling experienced a larger mortality rate than did females, whereas no such differences were found in trout. It is suggested that grayling males invest more in reproduction than do females, due primarily to large investments in breeding behaviour. The equal mortality rates found for both sexes of trout, albeit males starting to spawn earlier than females, is probably explained by a female-selective fishing mortality.

TI  - Migration of lake running brown trout in the Hasliaare 2019 in context of abiotic factors
T2  - WASSERWIRTSCHAFT
LA  - German
AB  - In this study the effects of abiotic factors (discharge, water temperature, turbidity, light and weather conditions) on the behaviour of lake running brown trout (Salmo trutta) during spawning up- and downstream migration in the Hasliaare, Switzerland, were investigated. Trouts were counted during spawning migration in a residual flow section of the Hasliaare. The fish counting system consisted of a counting chamber (resistivity fish counter including several monitoring cameras) and a fish weir. 269 lake running brown trout movements were recorded between 15.09.2019 and 30.12.2019. Point pattern comparison was used to distinguish 104 trouts individually with 66.3 % females and 33.7 % males. Water temperatures below 4.9 degrees C interrupted or inhibited upstream spawning migration in the residual flow section of the Hasliaare. During downstream migration, activity increased at low barometric pressure and increased flows supported downstream migration of males and large females (6.0 cm). Furthermore, the entire migration preferably occurred in darkness.

AB  - Two-year-old hatchery-reared progeny of inlet- and outlet-spawning brown trout from Lake Tyrifjorden were released at the mouth of the R. Imsa, south-western Norway. There were significant differences in migratory direction of juveniles between the two populations. After release, juvenile fish from the outlet river population moved against the water current and ascended the R. Imsa, while the inlet river fish tended to migrate with the water current to the sea. This differential response to water current in juveniles appears to be due to genetic differences between the populations, and parallels that found in their ancestors' native environments.

AB  - Acoustic telemetry was utilised to track a sample of 80 adult wild brown trout across an extensive array of 30 receivers in Lower Lough Erne during 2016 and 2017. The mean detection duration across the array was 142 days, and the majority of tagged fish were detected consistently in the northern basin of the lake. One year after tagging, c.40% of larger fish (>45cm L-F) were still actively detected, while only 5-10% of smaller fish (<45cm L-F) were detected on the array. In total, nine trout were recaptured by anglers between 2 and 1,152 days post-tagging, with a mean liberty time of 152 days, and a minimum angling exploitation rate of 11.25%. A high proportion of surviving tagged trout (>50%) did not undertake spawning migrations into an influent tributary and remained active within the lake during the reproductive period in November. In total, fourteen tagged trout undertook spawning migrations into a range of tributaries; the mean spawning sojourn was 54 days, and five fish (36%) did not return to the lake post spawning.

AB  - Changes in the proportions of river- and lake-produced eggs of a landlocked amphidromous fish, ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis altivelis) in the Lake Biwa water system, Japan, were monitored by stable isotope analysis, based on different delta N-15 and delta C-13 values of prey organisms between the lake and its tributaries. During the 3 month reproduction season, the delta N-15 values of spawned eggs decreased with time. This result implies that there was a shift from lake-produced eggs to river-produced eggs within a reproductive season, based on the observation that adult fish in the lake had previously been shown to have eggs with distinctly higher delta N-15 values in their ovaries than those in the tributaries. This explanation was also supported by the change in delta C-13 values of the spawned eggs. Furthermore, eggs with lower delta N-15 and higher delta C-13 values tended to be spawned at less variable depths, suggesting that females spawning river-produced eggs selected the spawning sites from a narrower range. We conclude that stable isotope ratios of spawned eggs can be indicators of the relative contributions of different food chains and can enable comparisons of reproductive characteristics between types of egg.

AB  - In Lake Atnsjo, southeastern Norway, Arctic char Salvelinus alpinus and brown trout Salmo trutta both attained sexual maturity mainly at 6 years of age and older, usually at a body length larger than 26 cm.  Both species have been heavily exploited at least since the turn of the century.  The annual survival rate was estimated at 0.38 for Arctic char (age-groups 6-9) and 0.49 for brown trout (age-groups 4-9).  Mean female age at maturity was higher than the optimal age at maturity predicted if female reproductive success only depended on fecundity.  We argue that reproductive advantages of larger parental body size, due to high competitive ability during spawning, favored late female maturation and also limited the selective effect by the fishery for earlier maturation.

AB  - The emergence of lake-migratory brown trout Salmo trutta m. lacustris L. fry from natural redds was observed in a small lake outlet stream. A total of 1104 emerging fry were captured in traps in nine of the 12 investigated redds during three seasons. In 2005, all the fry emerged during the daytime, but in 2007 and 2009 they emerged mostly at night. Furthermore, the timing of emergence was earlier than expected from temperature models. The fry left the redds at a water temperature range of 6.2-15.0 degrees C, and the emergence pattern was correlated with the moon phase. The number of fry captured was strongly affected by the percentage of fine particles < 1 mm and the 8-16 mm particle content, and was positively correlated with the geometric mean of substrate particle size (D-g) and the index of permeability: the fredle index (f(i)). The estimated survival rate between egg deposition and fry emergence ranged from 0.0 to 59.8 % in individual redds. Additionally, the greatest number of fry and the highest survival rate were observed in redds that had the high water velocity and shortest duration of intragravel period.

AB  - 1. Introgression into natural salmonid populations from stocked conspecifics has been widely studied. Outcomes vary from no effect even after decades of stocking, to population replacement after only a couple of generations. Potential introgression caused by semi-supportive breeding (i.e. using a mixture of local strains as brood stock) is, however, less well studied.
   2. We investigated population structure of brown trout (Salmo trutta) in a regulated alpine lake with three natural, environmentally contrasting tributaries used as spawning and rearing habitat. Massive semi-supportive breeding of admixed local strains has been implemented for decades. Stocked trout represented c. 17% of the total lake population, and a substantial post-release survival reflects a considerable potential for introgression. However, the mark-recapture studies indicate no spawning runs of stocked fish.
   3. Using 13 polymorphic microsatellite loci, we found natural straying and non-native reproduction, especially among wild populations inhabiting environmentally unstable habitat. Retained genetic structure across tributaries indicated low reproductive success of wild-born non-natives. Moreover, the genetic structure among tributaries has probably not been influenced by semi-supportive breeding, because of recruitment failure of stocked trout.

AB  - This study describes some of the characteristics of the spawning runs of rainbow and brown trout from Lake Otamangakau, into Te Whaiau Stream. More than 55,000 fish undergoing spawning migrations were enumerated in a fish trap between 1994 and 2013. During that period, the spawning run size increased for both species, but particularly for rainbow trout, which exhibited a concurrent decline in average weight. The timing of the runs was consistent across both species, sexes, and maturation statuses but was affected by the average weight of the fish and the run size. The level of iteroparity revealed that 40% and 55% of the runs were made up of previous spawner rainbow and brown trout, respectively. Detections of PIT-tagged fish at the trap indicated that rainbow and brown trout could spawn up to six and eight times, respectively. Remarkably, repeat spawning fish of both species and sexes returned within a few days of the same date each year over consecutive spawning events. Rainbow and brown trout grew substantially after spawning up to the 3rd and 4th spawning, respectively. The results of this study are relevant for informing management of the popular Lake Otamangakau trout fishery, in particular achieving a balance between satisfactory CPUE and large fish size.

AB  - Lake Tinnsjo, Norway, has been heavily stocked over three decades with two different brown trout stocks. A population genetic survey based on 13 allozyme coding loci was conducted to investigate the genetic composition of the present trout population and the genetic impact of the two donors. Contrary to expectations, highly significant differences in allelic frequencies between Lake Tinnsjo trout and the two donor stocks were found at several loci, suggesting minimal gene flow from stocked trout to the wild populations. Pairwise genetic distance values were several times higher between donor stocks and Lake Tinnsjo samples than between the various spawning inlets to Lake Tinnsjo. F-st increased from 0.024 to 0.090, when samples from the donor stocks were included in the material. There were no deviations from expected Hardy-Weinberg distribution of genotypes in the spawning inlets. It was concluded that the donor stocks contributed little to the trout gene pool in the lake. A possible exception is the trout population below the lake outlet.

AB  - Long-term survey data detailing brown trout abundance in the Lough Erne catchment in Co. Fermanagh were tabulated from 1968-2016.These data included redd counts and electric fishing surveys across three key spawning tributaries in addition to gill-net surveys of the lake. The abundance of spawning adults fluctuated widely across the time-series and were examined in relation to various pressures, including a major disease epidemic and the invasion of the catchment by zebra mussels. A functional stock-recruitment relationship between adult spawners and young-of-year juveniles in the spawning tributaries was identified and described. Redd counts were significantly lower for the post-zebra mussel time-series (2000-16) than the pre-zebra mussel time-series (1968-99). The post-zebra mussel invasion period was associated with increased water clarity, reduced plankton productivity and changes to the balance of coarse fish species in the lake. The significance of these changes is discussed in relation to the trout stock.

AB  - Ferox trout are large, long-lived, piscivorous trout normally found in deep lakes; they are highly prized by trophy anglers. Lough Corrib and Lough Mask, Western Ireland, have recorded the majority of Irish specimen ferox trout since angling records began. Little was known regarding the spawning location of ferox trout relative to sympatric brown trout, and a radio telemetry study was initiated in both catchments in 2005. Over the period 2005-2009, 79 ferox were captured by angling and radio tagged in Lough Corrib, while 55 ferox were tagged in Lough Mask. Manual and helicopter tracking were carried out on all spawning streams entering both lakes over the autumn/winter period to detect tagged fish. Overall, 37 radio-tagged trout (46.8%) were detected in Lough Corrib streams and 21 tagged trout (38.2%) were recorded from Lough Mask streams. Results from radio tracking indicate that the majority (92%) of ferox trout tagged in Lough Corrib spawned in a single spawning stream, the Cong river, while the majority (76%) of ferox trout tagged in Lough Mask spawned in the Cong canal and Cong river. These results suggest that these streams are most likely the principle spawning locations of ferox trout in both lakes. The occurrence of ferox trout predominantly in single spawning rivers in both catchments highlights the vulnerability of the study ferox populations. As a result of these findings, conservation measures were introduced for ferox trout in both catchments.

AB  - A genetically marked hatchery strain of brown trout (Salmo trutta) was employed to study the genetic impact from non-indigenous hatchery fish on wild stocks. The hatchery spawners were released in autumn 1989 into the spawning localities of two wild trout stocks in River Oyreselv, Norway The F-1 generation was sampled and genotyped at the 0+, 1+, and 2+ stages. Juveniles carrying the genetic markers were found in both localities, proving that the introduced spawners had spawned among themselves and with the wild stocks. The genetic contribution from the hatchery fish was estimated at 19.2 and 16.3% at the 0+ stage in the two wild stocks. Estimates of survival rates of 0+ trout revealed that survival was nearly three times higher in wild trout than in hybrids of wild and introduced trout, possibly because of a difference between introduced and wild stocks in size of eggs and alevins. The frequency of the marker alleles in the F-1 generation declined during the 2-year observation period.

AB  - Background
   Long-term data from marked animals provide a wealth of opportunities for studies with high relevance to both basic ecological understanding and successful management in a changing world. The key strength of such data is that they allow us to quantify individual variation in vital rates (e.g. survival, growth, reproduction) and then link it mechanistically to dynamics at the population level. However, maintaining the collection of individual-based data over long time periods comes with large logistic efforts and costs and studies spanning over decades are therefore rare. This is the case particularly for migratory aquatic species, many of which are in decline despite their high ecological, cultural and economical value.
   New information
   This paper describes two unique publicly available time series of individual-based data originating from a 51-year mark-recapture study of a land-locked population of large-sized migratory brown trout (Salmo trutta) in Norway: the Hunder trout. In the period 1966-2015, nearly 14,000 adult Hunder trout have been captured and individually marked during their spawning migration from Lake Mjosa to the river Gubrandsdalslagen. Almost a third of those individuals were later recaptured alive during a later spawning run and/or captured by fishermen and reported dead or alive. This has resulted in the first data series: a markrecapture-recovery dataset spanning half a century and more than 18,000 capture records. The second data series consists of additional data on juvenile and adult growth and lifehistory schedules from half of the marked individuals, obtained by means of scale-sample analysis. The two datasets offer a rare long-term perspective on individuals and population dynamics and provide unique opportunities to gain insights into questions surrounding management, conservation and restoration of migratory salmonid populations and freshwater ecosystems.

AB  - Steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) ascend several Lake Ontario tributaries to spawn and juveniles are often the most abundant salmonid where spawning is successful. Movement and diet of recently emerged subyearling steelhead were examined in three New York tributaries of Lake Ontario. Downstream movement occurred mainly at night and consisted of significantly smaller fry that were feeding at lower levels than resident fry. Fry fed at the highest rate during the day and chironomids and baetids were the main components of their diet. The diet composition of steelhead fry was closely associated with the composition of the benthos in Trout Brook but more similar to the composition of the drift in the other streams. Daily ration was similar among streams, ranging from 10.2 to 14.3%. These findings are consistent with previous findings on the ecology of steelhead fry, as well as fry of other salmonid species.

AB  - Sevan trout, Salmo ischchan, dwelling in the mountain Lake Sevan (Caucasus) is a unique species complex. Four sympatric forms of Sevan trout were divergent in both their phenotypes and ecologies. Three forms were lacustrine spawners but were unique in their spawning times and the type of substrate. The fish community of Lake Sevan was strongly impacted by human activity in twentieth century. Two forms of Sevan trout went extinct in the 1980s and the other two forms are at the brink of extinction. The present study demonstrated that archived/historical scales of extinct forms stored at room temperature for up to 44 years are a suitable source of DNA for high-throughput sequencing and for the reconstruction of mitochondrial genomes. In addition, we obtained the mitochondrial genomes of the extant forms for comparison to the extinct forms and reconstruction of a mitogenomic phylogeny of all forms of Sevan trout. The mitogenome gene arrangement was identical in all individuals studied with structure similar to other Salmo spp. The nucleotide sequence divergence between sympatric forms was shallow (P-distance = 0.0003-0.0012). A phylogenetic tree based on mitogenomes confirmed sister position of Sevan trout to the Caspian trout, Salmo trutta caspius (P-distance = 0.0049).

AB  - We examined data from 1984 to 1994 for five species of lake Michigan salmonids to explore the relationship between total PCB concentration and percent lipid. When we compared mean species lipid and PCB values, we found a strong linear correlation. When we compared values among individuals, we found modest positive PCB:lipid associations in brown trout (Salmo trutta), chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) collected during spawning, but positive associations were not apparent among nonspawning individuals. Lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) exhibited no discernible PCB:lipid relationship. Our results are not incompatible with previous observations that contaminants are differentially partitioned into lipids within a fish, but these results do suggest that lipids are not a major factor influencing contaminant uptake.

AB  - The demography of a brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) population has been studied in a context of fed fry stocking in the case of the Redon River, an affluent of Lake Leman. The Redon River is a typical case history affluent with a zone open to the lake but quickly closed to upstream migration by the lake dwelling trout.
   The stocking with fed fry at densities 40-60 ind./ 100(2) supplied an additional recruitment, which can constitute the dominant part of 0 + and 1 + in autumnal standing population. Fry were reared from wild lake dwelling trout eggs issued from an affluent different from the Redon River or from domestic spawned eggs.
   In open angling areas, colonized or not by lake dwelling spawners, the autumnal standing population sharply decreased between 1 + and > 1 + stages. The comparative results between zones opened or closed to angling suggest the important role played by angling in this evolution. The comparative dynamic of resident trouts and trouts issued from stocked alevins of lacustrine origin in a section closed to angling suggests the existence of a smaller settling rate for trouts of lacustrine origin.
   An experimentation with fed fry from lacustrine origin suggests the existence of an early downstream migration, concerning fry with the higher initial growth rate.
   The study showed that:
   - fed fry from lacustrine or domestic origin, stocked in late-spring or early-summer, supplied lake dwelling trout spawners coming back in the river of stocking, in smaller proportion however for the domestic origin. In spite of their strong contribution at juveniles 0 + and 1 + stages, trouts from domestic origin contributed very few to the return of lake dwelling trout spawners.
   - in the case of one of the four surveyed cohorts, a limited stocking (6 000 fed fry issued from an other river) has had a major contribution to the stock of lake dwelling trout spawners entering the Redon River. The other releases have had more limited but not null contributions.
   Results suggest that stocking practices repeated during several decades could have potentially affected the integrity of natural populations.

AB  - P>The study examined if recruitment of juvenile Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., was influenced by the presence of European sculpin, Cottus gobio L., and if the spawning substrate size used by salmon influences sculpin predation on salmon eggs. A combination of information on spawning site selection by female salmon and associated densities of juvenile salmon indicated that recruitment of juvenile salmon was 10 times lower in areas where sculpin was present than areas without sculpin. Predation rate on salmon eggs was found to be dependent on substrate size in artificial redds created in stream aquaria using four different sizes of substrate (13, 23, 37 and 62 mm). Predation rate averaged 83% in the aquaria with the largest substrate size, whereas a rate of only 2-3% was observed using smaller substrate sizes. Sculpin may thus be an important factor influencing the recruitment of juvenile salmon. Selecting small enough gravel sizes during restoration of salmon spawning habitat could therefore be important to minimise egg predation.

AB  - The brown trout form the Salmo trutta complex, a diversified assemblage of salmonids. Its native area mainly covers Europe. It can develop three ecological forms or ecotypes, depending on its migratory behaviours: resident, anadromous (going to sea) and lacustrine (going to lakes). The sea trout is the anadromous ecotype, born up river, living at sea where it reaches salmon size, and returning to the river of its birth for spawning. Like other anadromous fish species, this natural ecotype is protected in France. While its distribution along the Atlantic coasts is known, the sea trout is considered absent in the Mediterranean basin. However, some isolated individuals have been observed in the Rhone River and some other rivers from southern France. In order to understand the genetic position of these large specimens swimming upstream in Mediterranean rivers, and despite the degraded DNA due to bad tissue preservation, eight samples of these trout, mainly caught by anglers, were successfully genotyped at seven microsatellite loci and three sequenced at the mitochondrial Control Region. All specimens tested belong to the Atlantic lineage and are probably stocked domestic trout. This study provides preliminary elements for the conservation status of this ecotype in the Mediterranean basin.

AB  - The locations and the area of the spawning-growing grounds have been assessed in the Syuskyuyanyoki River (the basin of Lake Ladoga), as has the population density of the juveniles of the freshwater form of the Atlantic salmon and the brown trout. The Atlantic salmon spawns at present on the rapids downstream of the hydroelectric power plant because of the insurmountable dam; the population density of this species has decreased dramatically. Only the landlocked form of the brown trout was found; the anadromous form was not. The brown trout has resettled along the major part of the river. We suggest that there are two subpopulations of the freshwater pearl mussel that differ with regard to the host for their larvae. The intensity of invasion of the juveniles of salmonids by the larvae of the freshwater pearl mussel and the survivability of glochidia did not depend on the host species. The growth rate of the mollusks and the age-size structure of the freshwater pearl mussel population have been assessed.

The fat content of fry was variable between streams and some streams had a higher inter-annual variation than others. The fat content of parr was also variable among streams but no difference could be found between seasons. The streams that produced fry with high fat content did not always produce parr with high fat content.

AB  - Anthropogenic acidification in SW-Scotland, from the early 19th Century onwards, led to the extinction of several loch (lake) brown trout (Salmo trutta) populations and substantial reductions in numbers in many others. Higher altitude populations with no stocking influence, which are isolated above natural and artificial barriers and subjected to the greatest effect of acidification, exhibited the least intrapopulation genetic diversity (34% of the allelic richness of the populations accessible to anadromous S. trutta). These, however, were characterised by the greatest interpopulation divergence (highest pairwise D-EST 0.61 and F-ST 0.53 in contemporary samples) based on 16 microsatellite loci and are among the most differentiated S. trutta populations in NW-Europe. Five lochs above impassable waterfalls, where S. trutta were thought to be extinct, are documented as having been stocked in the late 1980s or 1990s. All five lochs now support self-sustaining S. trutta populations; three as a direct result of restoration stocking and two adjoining lochs largely arising from a small remnant wild population in one, but with some stocking input. The genetically unique Loch Grannoch S. trutta, which has been shown to have a heritable increased tolerance to acid conditions, was successfully used as a donor stock to restore populations in two acidic lochs. Loch Fleet S. trutta, which were re-established from four separate donor sources in the late 1980s, showed differential contribution from these ancestors and a higher genetic diversity than all 17 natural loch populations examined in the area. Genetically distinct inlet and outlet spawning S. trutta populations were found in this loch. Three genetically distinct sympatric populations of S. trutta were identified in Loch Grannoch, most likely representing recruitment from the three main spawning rivers. A distinct genetic signature of Loch Leven S. trutta, the progenitor of many Scottish farm strains, facilitated detection of stocking with these strains. One artificially created loch was shown to have a population genetically very similar to Loch Leven S. trutta. In spite of recorded historical supplemental stocking with Loch Leven derived farm strains, much of the indigenous S. trutta genetic diversity in the area remains intact, aside from the effects of acidification induced bottlenecks. Overall genetic diversity and extant populations have been increased by allochthonous stocking.

TI  - DECLINE AND RESTORATION OF THE POPULATION OF MIGRATING LAKE-TROUT (SALMO-TRUTTA-LACUSTRIS L) OF LAKE CONSTANCE
T2  - BULLETIN FRANCAIS DE LA PECHE ET DE LA PISCICULTURE
LA  - French
AB  - The decline of the population of migrating lake-trout of Lake Constance started at the beginning of the 1950 s when a dam was built up in the most important tributary, the Rhine, preventing the spawners from the access to the most important spawning grounds.  On the pretext that a natural reproduction could no longer occur, the former size limit ensuring the ripening of the trouts was abandoned and rainbow trouts were heavily stocked to compensate the decline of the autochthonous trout population.  Finally also spawning ground of poorer importance were neglected and the catches dropped from 12,000 kg to 3,000 kg within 30 years.
   Different measures applied in the last years to restore the declining autochthonous trout population are obviously successful:  - three-year-closure for the trout-selective angling, - determination of a size limit and of closed seasons considering the reproduction of far and of short-distance migrating trouts, - rearing of parental stocks, - stockings done in tributaries instead of lake, - suppression of rainbow-trout stockings, - abolition of migrating barriers.
   Increasing catches of trouts in the commercial fishery as well as reestablished migrations in some accessible tributaries point to a progressing restoration.

AB  - Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus, tend to form stunted populations presumably due to competition for limited resources. In this context a long-term intensive fishery programme aiming at reducing charr density, and thereby increasing growth and harvestable sizes, was initiated in the early 1980s in a Norwegian alpine lake. Here we present long-term data on catch statistics and changes in mean weights of charr caught with gill nets on spawning grounds, as well as changes in mean weight of juvenile charr caught with funnel traps during the 1990s. Furthermore, we present results from shorter-term studies on growth, size- and age-distribution, and size-related habitat and resource utilisation of Arctic charr and brown trout, Salmo trutta, in this lake. Mean weight (+/-SD) of charr caught on the spawning grounds increased significantly from 129.8 g (+/-11.9) in the years 1982-1990 to 213.1 g (+/-37.8) in the years 1996-1999, whereas catch per unit of effort decreased significantly. Mean weight of juveniles caught in funnel traps increased significantly from 21.2 g (+/-6.9) in 1993 to 41.9 g (+/-14.8) in 1999. Apparently the increase in weight of spawning charr coincided with the onset of trap fishing for juvenile charr. Compared to generally shallow dwelling trout, charr grew rapidly and were generally found in deeper areas of the take. Charr went through a distinct size-related niche shift from mainly consuming small zooplankton in the pelagic to consuming large benthic prey in shallower waters. Resource and habitat utilisation in different size-groups of charr and trout are discussed with respect to possible competitive and predatory intra- and interspecific interactions, and with regard to management of charr populations.

AB  - Okanagan Lake, south-central interior of BC, contains two reproductive ecotypes of kokanee Oncorhynchus nerka; individuals spawn in tributary streams ('stream-spawners') as well as on shoreline gravel areas ('beach-spawners'). We tested the hypothesis that these sympatric ecotypes comprise a single panmictic population by assaying variation in morphological traits and at allozyme, mitochondrial and minisatellite DNA loci in fish collected from three stream-spawning and two beach-spawning sites. No morphological traits consistently distinguished the reproductive ecotypes with the exception of the number of anal fin rays which was greater in stream-spawning kokanee. Four of 18 allozyme loci screened were polymorphic, but no significant allele frequency differences were detected among populations within ecotypes or between ecotypes. Similarly, allele frequencies at two minisatellite DNA loci were not significantly different among populations or between ecotypes. By contrast, significant differences in the frequencies of mitochondrial DNA restriction fragment length polymorphism (mtDNA RFLP) haplotypes were detected between stream- and beach-spawners, but not among populations within ecotypes. Further, two RFLPs that distinguished stream- and beach-spawning adults were found in juvenile kokanee sampled from the limnetic zone of Okanagan Lake. The two mtDNA RFLPs and a d-loop sequence variant appear to be unique to Okanagan Lake kokanee because we did not observe these haplotypes in sockeye salmon and kokanee sampled outside of Okanagan Lake. Our data suggest that: (i) there is restricted female-mediated gene flow between stream- and beach-spawning kokanee in Okanagan Lake, (ii) the forms have diverged within the lake basin since the retreat of the Wisconsinian glaciers (< approximate to 11 000 years ago), and (iii) distinct reproductive niches may promote divergence in north temperate freshwater fish faunas.

AB  - Rocky reefs provide important spawning and refuge habitats for lithophilic spawning fishes. However, many reefs have been lost or severely degraded through anthropogenic effects like dredging, channelization, or sedimentation. Constructed reefs have been used to mitigate these effects in some systems, but these reefs are also subject to degradation which may warrant custodial maintenance. Monitoring and maintenance of natural or constructed spawning reefs are not common practices; therefore, few methodologies have been created to test the effectiveness of such tools. We conducted a literature review to assess available information on maintenance of rocky spawning habitats used by lithophilic fishes. We identified 54 rocky spawning habitat maintenance projects, most of which aimed to improve fish spawning habitats through the addition of spawning substrate (n= 33) or cleaning of substrate (n= 23). In comparison to shallow riverine studies focused on salmonids, we found little information on deep-water reefs, marine reefs, or other fish species. We discuss the possible application of potential spawning habitat cleaning methods from other disciplines (e.g., treasure hunting; archeology) that may provide effective means of reef maintenance that can be used by restoration practitioners.

AB  - Certain spawning areas of the critically endangered Lake Saimaa landlocked Atlantic salmon (Salmo solar m. sebago) have been recently restored by excavator- and helicopter-scattered gravel, but the success of applied methodologies has remained open. Here, we monitored the spawning-related movements and redds occurrence of transported semi-wild and hatchery-reared salmon in the restored River Ala-Koitajoki, eastern Finland, using radiotelemetry and snorkeling. Nearly all fish accepted the newly restored spawning habitats in the river that maintains a low flow rate (only 4 m(3).s(-1)). The movements of females released up to 2 weeks before spawning time were restricted mainly to the closest rapids from the release site, and most of the movements were directed downstream. Semi-wild and hatchery background fish exhibited similar mobility, which was more variable among males. A majority of redds were found in restored areas, and both helicopterand excavator-scattered gravels were accepted as spawning substrates. Our results indicate that natural reproduction of the studied landlocked salmon population can be successfully returned to its original spawning river by restoration of habitats and transfer of spawners.

AB  - The spawning migration and local homing of adult brown trout was analysed using radio telemetry in a regulated river in central Norway. Twenty-eight large (37-64 cm) brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) were tracked before, during and after spawning in the River Nea, a watercourse with several obstructions, including an outlet tunnel from a power station and a regulated stretch (26 km) with 45 weirs.
   Two major patterns of spawning migration were found: (1) about half (n = 16; 57%) of the trout moved very little and remained in the deeper pools of the river from June until November; (2) about half (n = 12; 43%) of the trout migrated relatively long distances (12.5-28 km) up the river prior to the spawning period where they stayed in the outlets of small tributaries, or in rapids on the main river during the spawning period. We assume that these trout belong to a population of lake-run migratory trout using the River Nea for spawning.
   There was no significant difference in body length of migratory and stationary brown trout and no significant difference in total distance moved by migratory males (30.5 km, n = 6) and females (20.5 km, n = 6, p > 0.05). Among migratory trout, we found no correlation between body length and migrated distance. Of the 12 migratory trout, nine undertook fast upward migration in periods of high water flow ( > 100 m(3)/s). They passed the outlet tunnel from the power station and negotiated two to 35 weirs before reaching their main reproduction areas. Three trout crossed several weirs when the discharge was low (10-40 m(3)/s). When there was low discharge, fish remained at the outlet tunnel for up to four weeks and showed a high level of activity. Postspawning downstream migration started between 25 September and 25 October. Most migratory trout (n = 9) wintered in pools on the lower part of the river or in weir basins; only two trout descended to the lake (Selbusjoen) in late autumn.

AB  - We modified, parameterized, and applied the individual-based model inSTREAM version 6.1 for lake-migrating populations of landlocked Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and brown trout (S. trutta) in a residual flow stretch of the hydropower-regulated Gullspang River, Sweden. This model description is structured according to the TRACE model description framework. Our aim was to model responses in salmonid recruitment to alternative scenarios of flow release and other environmental alterations. The main response variable was the number of large out-migrating juvenile fish per year, with the assumption that individuals are more inclined to out-migrate the larger they get, and that migration is an obligatory strategy. Population and species-specific parameters were set based on local electrofishing surveys, redd surveys, physical habitat surveys, broodstock data as well as scientific literature.& BULL; Simulations were set to run over 10 years, with sub-daily time steps, in this spatially and temporally explicit model.& BULL; Model calibration and validation of fish growth was done using data on juvenile fish from electrofishing.& BULL; The results were found to be sensitive to parameter values for aggregated fish, i.e., "superindividuals " and for the high temperature limit to spawning.

AB  - Supportive breeding with subsequent stocking is an important long-term conservation tool for sustaining harvestable populations and genetic diversity in wild fish populations. In salmonids, this strategy often implies, inadvertently or for logistic reasons, breeding of a mixture of local populations, which may lead to loss of local adaptation and pose risks to receiving populations. In an alpine lake system in Norway (Palsbu-Tunhovd), we assessed long-term effects of interbreeding three brown trout (Salmo trutta) populations from separate and environmentally contrasting spawning and recruitment habitats. Using a Bayesian genetic assignment algorithm we compared numeric contributions and genetic and demographic characteristics of wild-born and lake-stocked fish within and across populations. Population contribution by the broodstock was disproportional to the number of surviving and reproductively ready stocked brown trout, indicating higher lifetime survival for brown trout descending from a large river dominated by large fish. Life history selection was further indicated by a discrepancy between observed and expected numbers of adult hybrids, i.e., fewer hybrids suggest negative fitness effects of hybridization. Hence, supportive breeding changed gene frequencies, although reduced genetic variation was not documented in mature stocked brown trout. Post stocking, these fish retained the initial length advantage relative to the fastest-growing wild-born population until the age of ten. Stocked brown trout had similar growth rates regardless of genetic origin, whereas wild-born brown trout growth rates differed among recruitment habitats. Our study in this system indicates that genetic origin determined longevity. Genetics may be a less important determinant for growth rates in lake-stocked than in wild-born brown trout.

AB  - In Nunavik, anadromous Arctic char spend more than 6 months under ice-covered habitats, mainly in lakes. Their winter habitats in this region have been scarcely studied due to the challenging logistics in the Arctic. In this study, we worked with Inuit fishers to characterize the winter habitat and incubation areas used by Arctic chars in five overwintering lakes and one lentic river reach. The collaborating fishers determined char occupancy of certain areas related to fishing sites (presence, absence, and spawning) and conducted measurements to characterize the sites while performing their fishing activities. The data showed that incubation areas were associated with significantly shallower depths and warmer (albeit not statistically significant) lake bottom temperatures than sites where no spawning occurs, which is beneficial for egg maturation. The productivity of these areas is also beneficial for fry that hatch during winter. Adult and post-smolt habitats tended to be associated with cold littoral zone, but their habitat did not show any other distinct characteristics. This exploratory study adds insights into the cryptic characteristics of the Arctic char winter habitat use, thanks to the Inuit fishers' knowledge of fish habitats and movements, and the experience and expertise they have acquired working in the local environment.

AB  - The development of the ecosystem of Lake Kezenoi-Am (Eisenam) over the past hundred years is described based on literature data and original materials. The ecosystem underwent a catastrophic transformation as a result of the introduction of the chub (Squalius cephalus orientalis Linnaeus, 1758) in the middle of the 20th century and the European perch (Perca fluviatilis Linnaeus, 1758) in 2013-2014. According to our studies and collected survey data, the endemic subspecies the Kezenoi-Am trout (Salmo trutta ezenami Berg, 1948), which was previously represented by two sympatric forms spawning in the lake and in brooks, has almost completely disappeared. The multifold increase in the intensity of net fishing is an additional factor promoting the degradation of the ecosystem. At present, the European perch predominates in the reservoir, and the chub is a subdominant species. Native fish species are currently inhabiting the ecosystem periphery. The Caspian gudgeon (Gobio holurus Fowler, 1976) is found only in the lower reaches of the tributaries. The Kezenoi-Am trout has completely disappeared in the lake basin and currently is found presumably only in the upper reaches of the tributaries. Based on an analysis of the literature data on the transformation of similar ecosystems, we argue that the consequences of the degradation of Lake Kezenoi-Am fauna are irreversible; thus, the Kezenoi-Am trout, which is listed in the Red Book, will disappear totally in the coming years. Urgent measures are required to preserve this endemic species, including artificial trout breeding and reclamation measures to reduce the number of introduced species.

AB  - Mortality that occurs during larval dispersal as a consequence of environmental, maternal, and genetic effects and their interactions can affect annual recruitment in fish populations. We studied larval lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) drift for two consecutive nights to examine whether larvae from different females exposed to the same environmental conditions during dispersal differed in relative levels of mortality. We estimated proportional contributions of females to larval collections and relative larval loss among females as larvae dispersed downstream between two sampling sites based on genetically determined parentage. Larval collections were composed of unequal proportions of offspring from different females that spawned at upstream and downstream locations (similar to 0.8 km apart). Hourly dispersal patterns of larvae produced from females spawning at both locations were similar, with the largest number of larvae observed during 22:00-23:00 h. Estimated relative larval loss did not differ significantly among females as larvae were sampled at two sites approximately 0.15 and 1.5 km from the last section downstream of spawning locations. High inter- and intra-female variation in larval contributions and relative larval loss between nights may be a common feature of lake sturgeon and other migratory fish species, and likely is a source of inter-annual and intra-annual variation in fish recruitment.

AB  - Roach populations from different parts of the network of the French Upper Rhone and from Lake Geneva were examined.  Several populations were discriminated by the electrophoresis of 16 enzymes coded for by 28 gene loci.
   90% of the overall genetic variation was due to intrapopulation variation.  Some affinity was found between the populations of Lake Geneva and the Rhone immediately downstream, but the stocks of the Rhone farther down proved to be clearly distinct from these genetic distance D = 0.048) and probably included several independently reproducing populations.  One of these populations was only found in the channel, others inhabited a side arm (D between them = 0.035) or succeeded each other in it, presumably in connection with spawning migrations.

AB  - The study examined the barely investigated upstream and downstream migration of the lake-run brown trout (Salmo trutta) in the Hasliaare in Switzerland. The video monitoring setup of two resistivity fish counters and a multi-spectral under water camera system provided a permanent registration of migratory movements. The migration corridor between the counters was analysed towards limitations of dis-charge and water depth. Environmental parameters were analysed with the use of regression tree analysis regarding their influence on the migration. 129 lake trout spawners were differentiated through their unique spot pattern, which allowed conclusions to be drawn about their migratory behaviour. Water depth did not show to be a limiting factor during the spawning period and provided migrating fish with suitable water depths. The results demonstrate that both video moni-toring setups provide harmless and effective methods for migratory salmonids in open river stretches, especially regard-ing critically endangered fish populations.

AB  - Independence Lake (Nevada and Sierra counties, California) harbors the only extant native population of Lahontan cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarkii henshawi in the Truckee River system and one of two extant adfluvial populations in the Lahontan basin. The persistence of this population has been precarious for more than 50 years, with spawning runs consisting of only 30-150 fish. It is assumed that this population was much larger prior to the introduction of nonnative brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis. Brook trout overlap with cutthroat trout in upper Independence Creek, where the cutthroat trout spawn and their resulting progeny emigrate to Independence Lake. In 2005, we began removing brook trout from upper Independence Creek using electrofishers and monitored the cutthroat trout population. Stomach analysis of captured brook trout revealed cutthroat trout fry, and cutthroat trout fry survival increased significantly from 4% to 12% with brook trout removal. Prior to brook trout removal, the only Lahontan cutthroat trout progeny emigrating to Independence Lake were fry; with brook trout removal, juveniles were found entering the lake. In 2010, 237 potential spawners passed a prefabricated weir upstream of Independence Lake. Although the results of this study suggest that brook trout removal from upper Independence Creek has had a positive influence on the population dynamics of Independence Lake Lahontan cutthroat trout, additional years of removal are needed to assess the ultimate effect this action will have upon the cutthroat trout population.

AB  - Van Campens Brook is a circumneutral stream in northwestern New Jersey that supports reproducing populations of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), brown trout (Salmo trutta) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). A short-term pH depression occurred in the stream following a snowmelt in the spring of 1984. A stream pH of 4.5 was recorded shortly after the onset of the snowmelt and the pH remained depressed (5.2) a week later. Stream pH did not fall below 6.2 following other rain and snowmelt events monitored during 1985-1987. An electrofishing survey conducted in 1985 revealed a near-total absence of 1984 year-class rainbow trout, spring spawners that are highly sensitive to acidity. Brook and brown trout spawning appeared to be unaffected. Rainbow trout reproductive success was good during 1985-87.

AB  - Five ecologically and phenotypically divergent ecomorphs of the genus Salmo are known from a landlocked alpine lake in the Caucasus, Lake Sevan. It is an example of sympatric diversification within a species-rich lineage with predominate mode of speciation being allopatric. The diversification of Sevan trouts was accompanied by spawning resource partitioning. Four lacustrine ecomorphs with different temporal-spatial spawning strategies and divergent morphology and coloration evolved along with a fifth ecomorph, brook trout, inhabiting the tributaries. Unfortunately, the Sevan trout diversity was almost destroyed by human activity, with two ecomorphs becoming extinct in the 1980s. We performed reconstruction of the evolutionary history of Sevan trouts based on high-throughput sequencing of both contemporary and historical DNA (similar to 50 y.o.) of all Sevan trout ecomorphs. Our study of complete mitogenomes along with genome-wide SNP data revealed the monophyly of four lacustrine ecomorphs and local brook trout, all derived from the anadromous form Caspian salmon, S. caspius. The species tree suggests a scenario of stepwise evolution from riverine to lacustrine spawning. Three genomic clusters were revealed, of which two refer to the riverine and lacustrine spawners within the flock of Sevan trouts (with F-ST value = 0.069). A few SNP outliers under selection were discovered that could be responsible for assortative mating based on visual recognition. The Holocene climatic oscillations and the desiccation of tributaries could have played an important role in the origin of lacustrine spawning. The relationships between lacustrine ecomorphs were not yet fully resolved. This radiation warrants further investigation.

AB  - Repeat salmonid spawners may make large contributions to total recruitment and long term population stability. Despite their potential importance, relatively little is known about this phase of the life history for anadromous populations, and nothing has been reported for landlocked populations. Here, we studied post-spawning behaviour and survival of landlocked Atlantic salmon in relation to downstream dam passage in the River Klaralven, Sweden. Eight hydropower stations separate the feeding grounds in Lake Vanern from the spawning grounds in the River Klaralven, and no measures to facilitate downstream migration are present in the river. Forty-nine percent of the salmon survived spawning and initiated downstream migration. Females and small fish had higher post-spawning survival than males and large fish. The post-spawners migrated downstream in autumn and spring and remained relatively inactive in the river during winter. Downstream migration speed in the free flowing part of the river was highly variable with a median of 9.30km/day. Most fish passed the first hydropower station via upward-opening spill gates after a median residence time in the forebay of 25min. However, no tagged fish survived passage of all eight hydropower stations to reach Lake Vanern. This result underscores the need for remedial measures to increase the survival of downstream migrating kelts. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Salmon Salmo salar L. and brown trout S. trutta L. juveniles were examined for the presence of accidental monogenean ectoparasitic species of Gyrodactylus Nordmann, 1832 in the Baltic and White Sea basins of Russian Karelia in order to estimate the frequency of host-switching attempts on an ecological timescale. To collect phylogeographical information and for exact species identification, the parasites were characterised by nuclear internal transcribed spacer sequences of rDNA (ITS) and, for some species, also by their mitochondrial DNA (CO1 gene) sequences. Four accidental Gyrodactylus species were observed on salmon and brown trout. A few specimens of G. aphyae Malmberg, 1957, the normal host of which is the Eurasian minnow Phoxinus phoxinus (L.), were observed on lake salmon from the Rivers Kurzhma (Lake Kuito, White Sea basin) and Vidlitsa (Lake Ladoga, Baltic basin). G. lucii Kulakovskaya, 1952, a parasite of the northern pike Esox lucius L., was observed on salmon in the Kurzhma. In the River Vidlitsa, two specimens of G. papernai Ergens & Bychowsky, 1967, normally on stone loach Barbatula barbatula (L.), were found on salmon. On anadromous White Sea salmon in the River Pulonga in Chupa Bay, a few salmon parr carried small colonies of G. arcuatus Bychowsky, 1933, which were shown to have originated from the local three-spined stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus L. consumed as prey. No specimens of Gyrodactylus salaris Malmberg, 1957 were observed, although the Pulonga is the nearest salmon spawning river to the River Keret', which is heavily infected with introduced G. salaris. In the River Satulinoja, Lake Ladoga, three specimens of G. lotae Gusev, 1953, from burbot Lota lota (L.), were collected from a single brown trout S. trutta. All nonspecific gyrodactylid infections on salmonids were judged to be temporary, because only a few specimens were observed on each of the small number of infected fishes. The prevalence of endemic G. salaris was also low, only 1% (N-fish = 296) in Lake Onega and 0.7% (N-fish = 255) in Lake Ladoga, while brown trout specific Gyrodactylus species were not observed on any of the 429 trout examined from the Ladoga basin. The host-specific and unspecific burden of Gyrodactylus spp. on these 'glacial relict' populations of salmon and brown trout was very low, suggesting a generalised resistance against the co-evolved freshwater parasite community, or some kind of 'vaccination' effect. These hypotheses deserve further testing.

AB  - P>Wild stocks of brown trout, Salmo trutta L., collapsed in Finnish inland waters during the 20th Century because dams prevented upstream migration, and low water quality and stream dredging weakened reproduction. The demise in migratory stocks was coupled with overfishing, mainly by gillnetting on lakes. Consequently, the migratory spawning stocks have diminished to negligible levels. The remaining stocks exhibit restricted immigration and emigration, are supplemented by continuous stocking, and their natural genetic diversity is affected by human activities. In recent years, various recovery actions have been implemented including stream channel restorations, fish passage facilities constructed and stocking of eggs and smolts. Gillnetting has also been regulated by banning certain mesh sizes, and catch-and-release of wild trout is spreading amongst sport fishers. However, these measures seem to be inadequate and almost no recovery of migratory populations has been reported. The problem of by-catch in intensive gillnetting continues to threaten stocks and creates disputes between stakeholders.

AB  - Reproductive investment was determined in a population of stunted Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus, living in an ultra-oligotrophic alpine lake (altitude 1100 m) in central Norway (62degrees51'W). No reductions in somatic energy content (carcass and intestines) were detected during the spawning period. Post-spawning somatic lipid, protein and total energy content did not differ between male spawners, female spawners and immatures. The recorded reproductive output consisted of gonad tissue equivalent to 13% of total pre-spawning energy in females and 4% in males, respectively. Mean stored somatic lipid reserves were as low as 2.8% and did not change significantly from pre- (30 June) to post-spawning (1% October) samples. Female fecundity varied between 41 and 84 (mean 60) eggs, with a corresponding body length varying between 110 to 160 mm (mean 13%). Mean yearly survival rate after maturation was 70% for females and 64% for males, respectively. This particularly low reproductive investment is discussed in relation to environmental conditions and low resource availability.

AB  - Background: Animal feeding and spawning migrations may be limited by physical barriers and behavioral interactions. Dam constructions (e. g. hydropower) commonly include gateways for fish migrations to sustain ecological connectivity. Relative genetic impacts of fish passage devices versus natural processes (e. g. hybrid inferiority) are, however, rarely studied. We examined genetic (i.e. microsatellite) population connectivity of highly migrating lake-dwelling Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus), introduced 20 generations ago, across and within two subalpine lakes separated by a dam with a subterranean tunnel and spill gates after 7 generations. Due to water flow regime, the time window for fish migration is highly restricted.
   Results: Char populations, with similar genetic structuring and diversity observed across and within lakes, were admixed across the dam with fishways during feeding. For spawning, however, statistically significant, but very low population differentiation (theta; 0.002 - 0.013) was found in nine out of ten reproductive site comparisons, reflecting interactions between extensive migration (mean first generation (F-0) = 10.8%) and initial site fidelity. Simulations indicated that genetic drift among relatively small effective populations (mean N-e = 62) may have caused the observed contemporary differentiation. Novel Bayesian analyses indicated mean contributions of 71% F-0 population hybrids in spawning populations, of which 76% had maternal or paternal native origin.
   Conclusions: Ecological connectivity between lakes separated by a dam has been retained through construction of fishways for feeding migration. Considerable survival and homing to ancestral spawning sites in hybrid progeny was documented. Population differentiation despite preceding admixture is likely caused by contemporary reduced reproductive fitness of population hybrids. The study documents the beginning stages of population divergence among spatial aggregations with recent common ancestry.

AB  - The paper presents the characteristics (age, growth) of lake dwelling trout spawners sampled during five consecutive years in the river Redon, a small tributary (10 km) of Lake Leman (58.240 ha).  The young spawners of 2-3 years represented 73 % of males against only 33 % of females.  Scales examination indicated the occurrence of 1 (type 1:56 %), 2 (type 2:43 %) or 3 years (type 3:1 %) of slow "river type" initial growth.  The back calculated total length at one year was significantly higher for spawners of type 1 (129 mm) than for spawners of type 2 (100mm).  A batch of 6.000 fry (4 cm) prefed in hatchery, issued from lake dwelling trout spawners, was marked and stocked in august 1983 in the downstream part of river Redon.  The lake dwelling trout spawners issued from this small batch represented an important part (46 % of females and 22 % of males) of the corresponding adult cohort spawning in the river Redon.

AB  - Regulation of the catchment area of the Norwegian river Gudbrandsdalslagen began in 1919. The lowermost power station on the main river was completed in 1964 and is situated about 10 km above the large Norwegian lake, Mjosa. The lake is the foraging area of the Hunder strain of brown trout, the fastest growing of all Norwegian trout. The running of the power plant has led to a severe reduction in water flows below the dam, and the most important spawning and nursery areas of the Hunder strain has been affected. The natural smolt production has been permanently reduced. The rehabilitation programme has included the construction of a fish ladder through the dam and a fixed minimum flow. A hatchery was built and a stocking programme using the local strain was implemented. The effect of stocking has been the easiest of the relief measures to evaluate. Hatchery reared fish constitute a growing share of the spawning population. During the last three years their share has been close to 60%. Reared fish constitute 30-40% of the trout caught in Lake Mjosa. The average and best returns of tagged groups have been 25 and 50%, respectively, but return rates are highly dependent on release length and time and place of stocking.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to describe the annual variations in the density of an unexploited population of lotic brown trout Salmo trutta that has been censused annually for 19 years and to explore the importance of density-independent and density-dependent processes in regulating population size. Brown trout density and indices of stream discharge and water temperature were related to annual variations in natural mortality, recruitment, and growth. Annual mortality of age-1 and older (age-1+) brown trout ranged from 0.30 to 0.75 and was best explained by discharge during spring and by brown trout density. Recruitment to age I varied fivefold. Density of age-1 brown trout was inversely related to spawner density and positively related to discharge during the fall spawning period. The median length of age-1 brown trout was positively related to discharge during summer and fall. Relative weight was inversely related to the density of age-2+ brown trout. The interactive effects of discharge and brown trout density accounted for most of the annual variation in mortality. recruitment, and growth during the first year of life. Annual trends in the abundance of age-1+ brown trout were largely dictated by natural mortality.

AB  - The post-war fishery of Lake Ladoga can be divided according to its catch level into four periods. In the years 1945-1954 the total annual catch increased, and reached the level of 4000 tonnes. In this period the fish stocks that had increased during the war years were intensively exploited. However, this fishery was not in balance with the stocks during the period 1955-1963. As a consequence, the catch decreased drastically, being sometimes less than 2000 tonnes.
   Controlling the fishery restored the abundance of whitefish Coregonus lavaretus (L.) and zander Stizostedion lucioperca (L.). This increased the total annual catch to about 5500 tonnes in 1964-1989. However, the fishery control measures have not been sufficient to achieve the conservation of salmon Salmo salar L. m. sebago, brown trout Salmo trutta L. and the migratory lake whitefish stocks.
   A decrease in the total fish catch has been observed since 1990. This decrease may be related to the deterioration of the environment of Lake Ladoga, caused by anthropogenic factors. The unfavourable state of the ecosystem has led to decline of the whitefish stocks and, especially during the last few years, to drastical decline of zander.
   Acute problems, to be faced in the near future, are connected with the hatchery maintenance of several river-spawning stocks, e.g. salmon, brown trout and migratory whitefish, because the existing fish hatcheries are insufficient in capacity and technically outdated.

AB  - Food consumption, growth, fish length distributions, population sizes and habitat use of the salmonids in two lakes in the Hoylandet area were studied in 1986-89. The allopatric brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) in the tarn Royrtjonna (27 ha) fed mainly on organisms at the lake surface, crustacean plankton, Trichoptera and Chironomidae. Only 5% of the trout reached an age of 6 years and a length of 25 cm. Sexual maturation started at age 3 and a length of 14 cm. Through mark - recapture technique the number of trout >10 cm was estimated to 115 ha(-1). Growth, fish length frequencies and sexual maturation of the sympatric brown trout and Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus (L.)) in Lake Storgronningen (530 ha) were not much different. The Storgronningen charr fed chiefly on zooplankton which by volume represented 33% for the trout. The food consumption of Storgronningen trout was at maximum in July with 2.06 mg food (d.w.) per g live fish and for charr in September with 1.26 mg food. The maximum size-independent growth rate of trout was 5.2% day(-1) in late June, and for charr 4.1% day(-1) in late July. Seventy percent of their seasonal growth took place before 15 August. The charr stayed mainly deeper than 3-4 m, at water temperatures <15 degrees C. Brown trout stayed mainly the littoral zone and in near surface water of the pelagic. The number of pelagic charr was estimated hydroacustically to 50 ind. ha(-1). The charr spawn in the lake. Mean numbers of juvenile trout in the two largest tributaries were 26 and 48 per 100 m(2). Their annual length increment was 2.8-3.4 cm. No indication of acidification or other human induced impacts were found. The lakes and their tributaries represent complex aquatic systems, representative for pristine oligotrophic Norwegian lowland lakes.

AB  - We studied the effects of acidification on female sexual behavior in brown trout (Salmo trutta) and compared the results with those in hime (land-locked sockeye) salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) (Kitamura and Ikuta, 2000). The results were similar to those of sockeye salmon. Spawning brown trout were extremely sensitive to the acidity of ambient water, and nest-digging behavior was severely inhibited (p<0.05) by very slight acidification (pH below 6.4). However, there were some differences between the two species. Female trout and salmon showed almost no digging below pH 5.0 and 6.0 (Kitamura and Ikuta, 2000), respectively. When the ambient water was returned to nearly neutral (pH6.6) conditions, digging in hime salmon reappeared in 4 of the 6 fish tested (Kitamura and Ikuta, 2000), whereas digging in brown trout reappeared in all 6 fish tested. The above-mentioned differences in behavioral response between the two species appear to reflect the species difference in terms of vulnerability to acidification (Ikuta et al., 1992). Avoidance of slightly acidic water in selection of spawning site or cessation of spawning behavior in weakly acidic environments may be the most potent cause of the reduction of salmonid populations in the early stages of acidification.

AB  - Ontogenetic shifts in fish habitat use often occur to reduce the risk of predation or cannibalism. We examined the large- and small-scale spatial behavior of juvenile Bull Trout Salvelinus confluentus during the spawning migration of adfluvial adult Bull Trout into a tributary (Smith-Dorrien Creek, Alberta) where juveniles rear. We evaluated whether juvenile spatial behavior suggested a direct response to adults that may be interpreted as an attempt to reduce predation risk. Our results showed that the juvenile response to the influx of adults was size dependent, with larger juveniles migrating downstream into Lower Kananaskis Lake and smaller juveniles moving into shallower reaches and margins of the creek. From 1992 to 2002, the downstream migration of juveniles occurred after the upstream migration of spawning adults. Juveniles migrating downstream into the lake were predominantly age 3, with some age-2 individuals. The lateral movement of juvenile Bull Trout in the creek in response to the presence of adult Bull Trout spawners was also assessed by comparing water depths occupied before, during, and after the spawning period. Median depths of water used by juveniles decreased when adults were present and then shifted to prespawning water depths once spawners had left the creek to return to the lake. These results suggest that behaviorally driven habitat segregation of juvenile and adult Bull Trout occurs at both a small scale (within the creek) and a large scale (within the watershed), likely to reduce cannibalism and to maximize juvenile survival.

AB  - Reintroduction or rehabilitation plans for fish populations in many systems (e.g., lakes) are complicated by limited data on ecological and genetic characteristics before human disturbances occurred. While no two lakes have identical physical and biological characteristics, a growing body of empirical evidence nevertheless indicates that parallel patterns of population structuring may evolve within northern temperate fish species. Examining the population structuring in undisturbed lakes of similar physical and biological characteristics may thus provide insight into the probable historical extent and causes of both population structuring and connectivity in human-impacted lakes. Here, we review research on the population structuring and evolution of migratory brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis in a relatively undisturbed, postglacial lake (Mistassini Lake, Quebec). We provide information on lake habitat use, the morphology and life history characteristics of populations, diets, lakewide genetic population structure, seasonal migration characteristics between spawning and feeding areas, population evolutionary histories, and the prevalence of lake spawning. The biology of Mistassini Lake brook trout has a compelling number of similarities with what is known about that of the "coaster" form in Lake Superior and lake-migratory brook trout elsewhere. Our review also has several implications for the rehabilitation of coaster populations with respect to (1) clarifying the degree of natural connectivity between populations; (2) predicting the likelihood of recolonization of vacant habitats; (3) choosing candidate source populations for translocations; and more broadly, (4) understanding the spatial scale of probable local adaptation. Mistassini Lake therefore provides a useful case study that applies to lake-migratory trout elsewhere. We hope that our research will stimulate managers and biologists working on similar systems with pronounced human disturbances to consider the interplay between ecology and evolution in future conservation efforts.

AB  - Stocking with eggs has been widely used as a management measure to support degraded salmonid stocks. In Finland, Atlantic salmon and both seamigrating and lake-migrating brown trout are stocked as eggs, alevins, fry, parr, and smolt, whereas trout are also stocked as mature fish. The aim of this stocking is to improve catches and to support collapsed spawning stocks. We assessed the success of stocking with brown trout eggs in a study of 17 Finnish boreal forest rivers, of which 9 were subject to egg stocking. All rivers contained some naturally spawning trout. In 16 rivers, including non-stocking years and unstocked rivers, egg stocking did not increase the total (wild and stocked) density of 0-year-old parr. However, those rivers with higher existing trout densities in non-stocking years seemed to benefit most from stocking, suggesting some role of river-specific extrinsic factors affecting egg-to-parr survival. In one river monitored for 14 years, only a weak correlation was found between the total density of 0-year-old parr and the number of eggs stocked. However, in nine parr samples from five rivers, the mean proportion of parr derived from stocked eggs was 40%. The mean survival to first autumn parr of egg-stocked and wild individuals was 1.0 and 3.3%, respectively. Probable reasons for the detected low to moderate impact of egg-stocking are (i) large variation in total parr density between years and rivers, (ii) small number of stocked eggs, (iii) placing egg boxes and egg pockets in unsuitable microhabitats, and (iv) unsuitable emergence time of egg-stocked individuals, or other extrinsic factors creating extra mortality. We recommend field and laboratory experiments to improve and standardize stocking methods, and monitoring the connection of wild spawning stocks and parr recruitment. Finally, we encourage fishery authorities to create clear management goals for threatened wild salmonid stocks.

AB  - P>1. Despite the great interest in characterising fish reproductive habitat, the relationship between the selection of a given spawning site and individual fitness has not been experimentally tested.
   2. In this study, we used an in situ experimental approach to determine (i) the relative contribution of substrate characteristics as well as hydrological and physicochemical variables to small-scale redd site selection by brook charr, Salvelinus fontinalis (Mitchill) and (ii) if hatching and emergence success, used as a surrogate of fitness, are improved in selected compared to non-selected sites in both lake and stream habitats.
   3. Our results show that upwelling groundwater flow was always significantly higher in selected than in non-selected sites in both lake and stream habitats. We found no significant difference in the mean geometric substrate diameter and no consistent differences in substrate composition between selected and non-selected sites. Oxygen concentration was higher (significantly so in three of four comparisons) and conductivity tended to be lower in selected than in non-selected sites, while temperature showed no significant or consistent variations. We found a significant positive relationship between the selection of a given spawning habitat and hatching and emergence success in these systems.
   4. These results show that the main cue that brook charr use to select their spawning sites is upwelling groundwater in lake and stream habitats, and that active selection of these sites increases individual fitness. This suggests that natural selection acted on the same cues in lentic and lotic environments; this could have been highly adaptive in a species that used both habitats as colonisation routes after the last glaciation.

AB  - Anadromous and adfluvial fish can transport high concentrations of nutrients and energy into streams during spawning runs. While the ecological effects of their spawning migrations are variable, in some instances these fish contribute to increased nutrient concentrations, primary productivity, invertebrate biomass, and resident fish growth and survival in the nutrient-poor streams of the Pacific Northwest. In tributaries of the Great Lakes, the effects of introduced salmonid and native adfluvial fish are poorly documented. We conducted field experiments to determine the effects of a semelparous fall fish, Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, and an iteroparous spring fish, steelhead O. mykiss, on the ecology and productivity of two tributaries to the Muskegon River, Michigan, a Lake Michigan tributary. We sampled stream biota and water chemistry before and after the introduction of Chinook salmon carcasses and eggs in the fall and steelhead eggs in the spring in a tributary stream with natural spawning runs and in another tributary stream without runs but with carcass and egg additions. There was no response in terms of invertebrate density or water chemistry to spawning migrations or salmon carcass introductions in either tributary. The density of resident brown trout Salmo trutta increased in both stream types after the introduction of salmon carcasses in the fall, and energy consumption increased after the addition of salmon eggs in the fall and spring in the manipulated stream. Based on stomach content analysis, fish that had eggs in their stomachs also consumed more energy than fish that did not consume eggs. The results suggest that adfluvial fish may affect some tributaries of the Great Lakes by providing high-energy food sources to resident stream fish, but the potential effect of this egg consumption on resident fish growth and survival requires more research.

AB  - The acute effects on perch and long-term effects on whitefish were studied after liming one side of a lake [initial pH: 4.6-5.5; aluminium (Al): 29-54 mug L-1; Ca2+: 0.02-0.07 mmol L-1] that was divided into two parts with a plastic curtain. Some Al precipitation was observed on the gill surface of perch 1 day after liming; the concentration of plasma sodium of perch females in the limed side was also higher than in the acidic side. Nearly 6 months after liming, at the spawning time of whitefish, the plasma chloride concentration of whitefish in the limed side was higher and blood glucose concentration lower than in the acidic side. Four of five whitefish males from the limed side, but only one of five males and none of the five females from the acidic side, were ready to spawn. The growth of whitefish in the limed side was also more rapid. These changes illustrate that liming had no acute harmful effects on perch, and allowed whitefish to recover from acidity-related physiological stress.

AB  - In 1990, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and state agencies initiated an 8-year experimental sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) control program on Lake Champlain to reduce parasitic phase sea lamprey and increase sport fish survival and growth. Twenty-four 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol (TFM) treatments were conducted on 13 tributary systems, and nine Bayluscide treatments were conducted on five deltas. Most tributaries received two rounds of treatment, 4 years apart. Trap catches of spawning-phase sea lamprey in three monitored tributaries declined by 80-90% from 1989 to 1997, but nest counts were reduced by only 57% during the same period. Sixteen of 24 TFM treatments reduced ammocoetes to less than 10% of pre-treatment levels. Eight of nine Bayluscide treatments resulted in mean ammocoete mortality rates over 85% in caged test animals. Nontarget effects were noted among amphibians, mollusks, macroinvertebrates, native lamprey, and other fishes, and were higher for Bayluscide treatments than TFM. Recovery of delta taxa occurred within 4 years after treatment. Wounding rates on lake trout and Atlantic salmon were reduced in the Main Lake basin. Catches-per-unit-effort (CPUE) and estimated angler catch of lake trout increased. A moderate (25%), statistically significant increase in survival of 3-4 yr lake trout was noted. Returns of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) to tributaries increased significantly after treatment, and there was an estimated 3-fold increase in returns to the Main Lake sport fishery. Angler catches of brown (Salmo trutta) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were higher in 1997 than in 1990. Economic analysis of the program indicated a 3.5:1 economic benefit: cost ratio. Results indicate that the experimental control program was successful, and provide justification for continuing sea lamprey control on Lake Champlain.

AB  - Anadromous Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus, feed in the marine environment for several months during the summer and migrate back to fresh water in late summer to spawn and/or overwinter. While overwintering, anadromous Arctic charr are generally believed to reduce or cease feeding, and they are poorly described in their winter movement activity. This study used telemetry data collected from two locations to describe overwintering movement activity, including interindividual variation. Movement activity declined markedly during the ice-covered period, suggesting opportunistic maintenance feeding was used as an energy conservation strategy. Fall and spring movement was correlated with daylight hours, and ice break-up had a significant effect on the timing of outmigration. Movement activity was negatively correlated with body length, with smaller individuals being more active than larger fish. Although general activity patterns were evident, there were significant differences among individuals, particularly during spring immediately prior to lake departure. Lake size and individual differences in metabolic rate may account for some of this variation.

AB  - Anadromous Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) migrate back to fresh water in late summer to spawn and (or) overwinter. Upon freshwater entry, feeding is reduced or absent, and movement activity is restricted. While the physiological responses to low temperatures (e.g., growth, metabolism) are understood, specifics of the use of thermal habitat for overwintering remains poorly characterized. This study used acoustic and archival telemetry data from two lakes in southern Labrador, Canada, to study thermal habitat use during the ice-covered period. Results showed that lake-dwelling anadromous Arctic char predominantly occupied a narrow range of temperatures (0.5-2 degrees C) and used cooler temperatures available within the middle and upper water column. Use of the selected temperatures is likely a strategy that lowers metabolic costs and minimizes energy expenditure, preserving stored lipids for overwinter survival and the energetic costs of preparation for seaward migration. As Arctic char are visual feeders, use of the upper water column is also thought to aid foraging efficiency by increasing the likelihood of prey capture.

AB  - This project has been successful in meeting its objectives in terms of demonstrating that catchment liming techniques can restore acidified waters to conditions suitable for fish populations for relatively long periods. This improvement in conditions has extended to the inlet stream, which provides vital fish spawning and nursery areas, which are difficult to treat effectively be other means in remote locations. The project has also provided an assessment of the effectiveness of differing rates and modes of lime application. which suggest that only quite restricted parts of a catchment require treatment. This not only maximizes the cost-effectiveness of the treatments, but also helps to minimize any side-effects on, for example. moorland vegetation. The biological monitoring programme at Loch Fleet has also provided an assessment of the overall ecological consequences of adding limestone to naturally acidic and calcium-deficient ecosystems.

AB  - Inland fisheries can support complex social-ecological systems and contribute to food security. However, many target stocks lack monitoring and quantitative assessment. There may be scope to apply current data-limited assessment models in these fisheries. The Length-Based Spawning Potential Ratio (LB-SPR) model requires only fish length data and input estimates of key life history parameters. LB-SPR has been seldom applied in inland systems, partly due to the current model assumption of asymptotic fishing gear selection, characteristic of trawls. In contrast, most inland fisheries operate gillnets or hooks, having dome-shaped selection curves. This is problematic because the largest size classes of fish are not fully retained by the gear, but their absence in the catch will be assumed by the LB-SPR model to reflect fishing mortality. LB-SPR was extended to include dome-shaped selection. Case study assessments were undertaken using survey gillnet catches of brown trout Salmo trutta from four Irish lakes. Bayesian Monte Carlo methods were used to quantify uncertainty around estimates of life history parameters for each stock. Despite small sample sizes, the model produced estimates of SPR that corresponded to expert knowledge of stock status. The extended LB-SPR can be applied to assess data-limited inland fish stocks, and other stocks for which selection is dome-shaped.

AB  - Describing and understanding the relationship between streamflow and ecological processes is a classic problem in stream ecology and river management. We applied the individual-based model inSTREAM to describe the relationship between the dynamic river habitat and emergent population responses in sympatric landlocked Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and lake-migrating brown trout (Salmo trutta). This application explicitly describes the environmental conditions in the Gullspang Rapids, a residual flow stretch in the hydropower-regulated Gullspang River, Sweden (Svenskt elfiskeregister - SERS, 2019) etween September 2008 and September 2018. We simulated three static minimum flow scenarios and three variable natural flow regimes, contrasting highly artificial conditions with more natural dynamics. Our main response variable was the number of large (>= 12 cm) out-migrants of salmon and trout, a proxy for successful population recruitment. The baseline model predicted an average production of 455 salmon and 532 trout out-migrants per year during 2008-2018 in this 11,700 m(2) spawning and rearing area. The only alternative scenario producing more out-migrants was when the minimum flow was raised by a factor of three, as this led to a modest increase in trout out-migrants. Interestingly, none of the flow alternatives produced more salmon out-migrants than the baseline model, suggesting a competitive disadvantage originating from spawning later than trout. Density-dependent population regulation, a well-known phenomenon in salmonids, was reproduced by the model. Both intra- and interspecific competition was evident. While the number of out-migrants varied with flow regime, sensitivity analyses showed that other model input, specifically velocity shelter availability and stream temperature, were just as important. Increased availability of velocity shelters (in-stream structures that reduces the swimming speed of drift-feeding fish) was the only environmental factor that increased production of both salmon and trout in silico. We conclude that in this system, flow restoration based on simplistic flow scenarios will have limited effect, unless complemented by an increase of instream structural complexity.

AB  - Simple Summary Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) causes serious disease in salmonid species, especially in fry. In 2016, we identified an IPNV infected sea trout in Lake Vanern in Sweden. Lake Vanern hosts four small populations of landlocked Atlantic salmon and sea trout that each migrate annually to two different rivers to spawn. The virus was isolated and after sequencing placed it in genogroup 6. The pathogenicity of the virus was investigated in an infection trial in Atlantic salmon, sea trout, and rainbow trout. In the trial, the novel isolate was compared to an isolate of genogroup 5, that usually cause high mortalities. By the end of the trial, the Swedish genogroup 6 isolate only caused mild infection in all three species, suggesting a low pathogenicity. In addition, the prevalence of the virus was monitored by intensified field sampling and PCR analysis from 2016-2020. During this time, the virus was not detected once, thus suggesting a prevalence in the wild of 0.2-0.5%. The low pathogenicity of the local IPNV isolate means that the salmonid populations of fish in Lake Vanern are not immediately threatened. In November 2016, infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) was isolated from a broodstock female of landlocked sea trout (Salmo trutta) in Lake Vanern in Sweden. VP2 gene sequencing placed the IPNV isolate in genogroup 6, for which pathogenicity is largely unknown. Lake Vanern hosts landlocked sea trout and salmon populations that are endangered, and thus the introduction of new pathogens poses a major threat. In this study we characterized the novel isolate by conducting an infection trial on three salmonid species present in Lake Vanern, whole genome sequencing of the isolate, and prevalence studies in the wild sea trout and salmon in Lake Vanern. During the infection trial, the pathogenicity of the Swedish isolate was compared to that of a pathogenic genogroup 5 isolate. Dead or moribund fish were collected, pooled, and analyzed by cell culture to identify infected individuals. In the trial, the Swedish isolate was detected in fewer sample pools in all three species compared to the genogroup 5 isolate. In addition, the prevalence studies showed a low prevalence (0.2-0.5%) of the virus in the feral salmonids in Lake Vanern. Together the data suggest that the novel Swedish IPNV genogroup 6 isolate is only mildly pathogenic to salmonids.

AB  - For the past several decades the Lake Mohave population of the federally endangered razorback sucker, Xyrauchen texanus, has had no natural recruitment because of intensive predation on larvae by non-native fishes. In response to impending extirpation, a repatriation program was implemented where larval razorbacks are collected from the wild following natural spawning, reared in protective custody, and then repatriated at a much larger size. In this study, we estimated annual (N-bf) and generational female effective size (N-ef) of the spawning stock by characterizing temporal genetic changes in mtDNA among larval cohorts, and then compared these estimates to the estimated number of reproductively capable (adult) females in Lake Mohave (N-f). Razorback suckers have life history and mortality schedules that could yield values of N-ef/N-f as low as 10(-5) due to match-mismatch recruitment (or the "Hedgecock effect") that increases variance in reproductive success. Average N (bf) was estimated to be 160, N-ef was 706, and the ratio N-ef/N-f was 0.29 and 0.38 for arithmetic and harmonic mean N (f), respectively. Our findings indicate that (i) larval sampling in Lake Mohave sufficiently encompasses temporal and spatial variation within annual larval cohorts as to be representative of the spawning stock, (ii) roughly 3-16% (about 8% on average) of adult females contribute genetically to larval cohorts each year, and (iii) repatriated fishes appear to be contributing genetically to larval cohorts. Simultaneous genetic and demographic monitoring offers insights that neither approach can provide alone into effects of population decline and management practices in this species.

AB  - We estimated long-range spawning and foraging movements of walleye and observed their use of river and reservoir habitats between two large hydroelectric dams on the Au Sable River, Michigan. We used radiotelemetry to monitor seasonal and daily movements of 11 large walleye. Walleye ranged throughout the entire reach between the two dams. Eight of the 11 fish used both river and reservoir locations. Walleye migrated upriver in April or May and presumably spawned near the dam tailwaters. After spawning, walleye remained in the river for up to 6 months, usually establishing local ranges. During this time, they occupied low-velocity refuges within the first 25 km of the upstream dam. They seldom occupied the downstream area, which has higher variation around the mean temperature. Food availability and water temperature may have affected the length of time that walleye remained in the river after spawning. All walleye overwintered in the reservoir. We designed this study to evaluate if walleye have a potential negative impact on brown trout, Salmo trutta. In summer, walleye were often present near sites where fingerling trout were stocked. We found the highest potential for interaction between the two species occurs within the first 25 km of the upstream dam during summer. The movement patterns of and habitats used by large walleye validate concerns that walleye could compete with adult brown trout for food and resting sites and prey on juvenile brown trout.

AB  - The supportive stocking programs that aim to promote fisheries may increase straying among sympatric but genetically diverged populations and compromise local adaptations. We employed recapture sample data on coded wire tagged brown trout (Salmo trutta m. lacustris) from three hatchery-reared strains to study in which proportions they were represented as running spawners in the area of River Juutuanjoki, northern Finland. More specifically, we analysed how the migration tendency to the study river varied among the strains in relation to their different hatchery sites (local vs. non-local) and release areas (native river mouths vs. lake), manifesting in homing or straying behaviour. The strain native to River Juutuanjoki (JUU) and another strain originating from the adjacent River Siuttajoki (SIU) were maintained in a local hatchery using water of the studied river. The JUU strain was also reared in a non-local hatchery on the other side of the catchment area, together with the third strain originating from River Ivalojoki (IVA). The fish from each strain were released at ages 3 and 4 at the mouths of their original rivers and in the common feeding area of the Lake Inari. The JUU trout from the non-local hatchery were only released in the lake area. Release area did not affect the incidence of spawner samples in any of the strains. However, the JUU trout were significantly more likely represented than the SIU trout (3-4-fold difference), regardless of their common rearing site. When the JUU trout were reared in the non-local hatchery and thus lacked previous contact with their home river, their mean recapture probability among the spawner samples was significantly higher compared to the similarly treated IVA trout, and even slightly higher compared to the SIU trout. Irrespective of their release area, the IVA trout had significantly the lowest likelihood to become captured as spawners in the study river. The observed strain-dependent differences among lake-released fish suggest that JUU trout possessed a stronger genetic tendency to return to their native river for spawning than did the non-native strains, giving support for a hierarchical navigation hypothesis. We can also conclude that lake stockings from the local hatchery unlikely compromises the homing ability of JUU trout, in relation to their releases at the river mouth, and neither increases the undesirable incidence of spawners from the non-native strains.

AB  - Elevated stress experienced by a mother can compromise both her own reproductive success and that of her offspring. In this study, we investigated whether chronically stressed mothers experienced such effects in cooperatively breeding species, in which helpers at the nest potentially compound the negative effects of maternal stress. Using Neolamprologus pulcher, a group-living cichlid fish from Lake Tanganyika, we observed the effects of experimentally increased stress on female reproductive success (measured as inter-spawn interval, and number of eggs) as well as egg characteristics including egg size and cortisol concentrations. Stress levels were manipulated by repeated exposure to the acute stresses of chasing and netting. Stressed females had longer inter-spawn intervals and laid fewer, smaller eggs. Although no significant differences in egg cortisol concentrations were detected between control and stressed females, egg cortisol concentration fell between spawns in control but not in stressed fish. No effect of helper number was detected for any parameter examined, except there appeared to be less change in egg cortisol content in groups with helpers present. Our results suggest that stress imposes fitness costs on breeding females, and social regulation of a dominance hierarchy does not appear to exacerbate or alleviate the negative effects of maternal stress.

AB  - As the global climate warms, the fate of lacustrine fish is of huge concern, especially given their sensitivity as ectotherms to changes in water temperature. The Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinusL.) is a salmonid with a Holarctic distribution, with peripheral populations persisting at temperate latitudes, where it is found only in sufficiently cold, deep lakes. Thus, warmer temperatures in these habitats particularly during early life stages could have catastrophic consequences on population dynamics. Here, we combined lake temperature observations, a 1-D hydrodynamic model, and a multi-decadal climate reanalysis to show coherence in warming winter water temperatures in four European charr lakes near the southernmost limit of the species' distribution. Current maximum and mean winter temperatures are on average similar to 1 degrees C warmer compared to early the 1980s, and temperatures of 8.5 degrees C, adverse for high charr egg survival, have frequently been exceeded in recent winters. Simulations of winter lake temperatures toward century-end showed that these warming trends will continue, with further increases of 3-4 degrees C projected. An additional 324 total accumulated degree-days during winter is projected on average across lakes, which could impair egg quality and viability. We suggest that the perpetuating winter warming trends shown here will imperil the future status of these lakes as charr refugia and generally do not augur well for the fate of coldwater-adapted lake fish in a warming climate.

AB  - In northern Europe and America, the acidification of lakes and rivers induced by acid precipitation has damaged fish populations. At present, rapidly expanding industrial activities in East Asia have led to continuous increases in the quantity of emission of acidic pollutants, and rain of acidic levels of pH4 has precipitated throughout Japan. In this way, the effects of acid rain on fish populations have also been manifested in Japan. In order to examine the effects of low pH on the reproductive behavior of salmonids which are known to be acid-sensitive species, changes in the frequency of upstream behavior and spawning-related female nest-digging behavior in response to changes in pH were observed in mature hime salmon (land-locked sockeye salmon) Oncorhynchus nerka, brown trout Salmo trutta and Japanese char Salvelinus leucomaenis. Digging and upstream behavior were significantly inhibited in weakly acidic water of pH 5.8-6.4 formulated using sulfuric acid. Land-locked sockeye salmon was the most sensitive to changes in pH among the three species.

AB  - To understand links between substrate and recruitment of white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), I evaluated the effects of substrate condition on larval drift, hiding, and predation between hatch and 15 days posthatch (dph). Over porous substrates (small gravel = 1.2-1.9 cm; medium gravel = 2.5-5.0 cm; cobble = 10-15 cm), rapid interstitial hiding was observed from 0 to 6 dph at low water velocity (4 cm.s(-1)), whereas larvae drifted in response to nonporous substrates (sand < 0.2 cm; embedded cobble). Velocities of 20 cm.s(-1) led to significantly lower drift only at 1 dph over small gravel. Hiding occurred an average of 2.0-13.3 s after release at 0-6 dph. Predation by sculpins (Cottus spp.) on larval sturgeon also decreased significantly in response to porous substrates at 1 dph. The strongest expression of increased hiding and decreased predation when small gravel was available suggests that yolksac larvae prefer small interstitial spaces created by that substrate. Considering behavioural responses in preferred natural spawning habitat suggests yolksac larvae predominantly hide in the vicinity of spawning locations. Identification of strong effects of substrate condition on age-specific drift and survival suggests that substrate degradation may contribute to recruitment limitations for sturgeon.

AB  - During 2001-2003, we counted redds of Coastal Cutthroat Trout Oncorhynchus clarkii clarkii and measured microhabitat variables at fresh redds in Irely Creek upstream of Irely Lake in a largely undisturbed watershed within Olympic National Park, Washington. Redd numbers declined abruptly in 2003, the year after a dry summer caused the dewatering of Irely Lake; therefore, we continued the redd counts during 2004-2012 to determine whether pond dewatering was a factor in the decline and whether redd counts would track Irely Lake surface area. The estimated number of redds varied from a high of 51 (in 2002) to a low of 2 (in 2006, 2007, and 2010); increases in estimated redd number occurred after wetter summers, and decreases were observed after drier summers. This pattern was significant in chi-square tests for redd number and the change in redd number with Irely Lake condition in the preceding year ( dry, semi-dry, or wet). Rather than indicating juvenile mortality, the lack of a lag in response suggests the mortality of adults that would otherwise have spawned during the subsequent spring. The clear impact of dry summers in one of the wettest regions of North America underscores the important influence of hydrology on fish, even in the absence of other disturbances.

AB  - For species that utilize different habitats throughout their life cycle, the habitat limitation at a given stage can act as a bottleneck on population abundance, impacting density-dependent processes such as individual growth and survival. We explore the influence of habitat limitation on population dynamics by developing a multi-stage population model based on lake-dwelling rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) populations where adults occupy the lake habitat but use tributaries for spawning and juvenile rearing. The model details density-dependent ecological processes and ontogenetic habitat shifts, harvest mortality, and the impact of climate on growth. We ran model simulations using a range of early life stage habitat availabilities and climatic conditions representative of the native range of rainbow trout in Canada and compared the results to empirical data. The results suggest that (1) increases in early life stage habitat leads to increases in population abundance but, due to density-dependent processes, also results in slower growing stunted populations; (2) population bottlenecks can occur at any life stage, even at the adult stage if spawning and rearing habitats are abundant; (3) when the level of competition for early life stages is increased, inter-cohort competition can lead to population cycles. The model's conclusions are further reinforced by empirical data showing a similar trend in the relationship between fish density and maximum size and providing evidence that limited early life stage habitat leads to lower fish densities and larger fish size. We provide a model that links environmental conditions to population dynamics and is useful for fisheries management and habitat conservation decisions.

AB  - Minisatellite-based DNA profiling was used to investigate the dispersion of synchronously spawned families of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) fry from artificial nests in a natural stream. By the end of the summer, i.e., 17 weeks after hatching, detected dispersion was mainly downstream and less than 1 km. Within this distance, three families that had been stocked together showed different patterns of dispersion, with the relative abundance of each family changing systematically with distance downstream from the nest, but with no monopolization of any area or habitat type by any one family. The length of fry also changed systematically with distance downstream, with the patterns of change depending on family. For each family, fry were larger closer to the nest. Changes in habitat type had a common effect on the density and length of fry from all the families.

AB  - During the past 20 years, there have been prolonged vendace (Coregonus albula) recessions in several Finnish lakes. Hypotheses have been proposed that predation by brown trout (Salmo trutta m. lacustris) or perch (Perca fluviatilis) on young-of-the-year vendace could prevent the recovery of the vendace stocks from a low-density state. In this study, dynamic modelling was applied to examine the effect of predation, assuming a dome-shaped spawning stock-recruitment relationship for vendace, type II or III functional responses to predation by brown trout and perch, and a constant rate of fishing. The results showed that the form of the functional response is crucial in determining the significance of the predation on vendace stocks that have a steep dome-shaped stock-recruitment relationship. In all cases, however, predation by perch had more effect than that by brown trout, probably due to perch occupying the pelagic zone when the vendace stock is sparse. This may make the mortality of vendace increase with decreasing population density (depensatory mortality) at certain density levels.

AB  - Research within the Swedish FiRe project Reproductive Disturbances in Baltic Fish has focused mainly on the M74 syndrome, which has caused high mortality in fry of sea-run Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) from the Baltic Sea. At the end of the 4-year project, the cause of M74 is still not known, but the symptoms have been well described and treatment with thiamine (vitamin B-1) has been found to cure afflicted fry. The M74 syndrome shows great similarities to Early Mortality Syndrome (EMS) in salmonids from the North American Great Lakes. Both M74 and EMS are characterized by a diet-related deficiency of thiamine in fry and broodstocks. A combination of factors may contribute to M74, e.g. the diet of salmon in the Baltic Sea, the content of thiamine or thiaminase (an enzyme that degrades thiamine) in their prey fish, ecological changes in Baltic Sea food chains, and pollutants. The few remaining wild, naturally spawning populations of Baltic salmon are at great risk of extinction, as there is no practical method of treating them with thiamine to prevent M74, and they are subject to heavy fishing pressure in the Baltic Sea. A reproductive disturbance similar to M74 occurs in Baltic sea trout (S. trutta), although at lower frequencies than in salmon. The M74 syndrome does not occur in Baltic cod (Gadus morhua), whose reproductive success is impaired mainly by poor oxygen conditions in its deepwater spawning grounds, in combination with heavy fishing pressure on large cod.

TI  - AN EVALUATION OF THE INTRODUCTORY TRIALS OF THE BROWN TROUT (SALMO-TRUTTA) IN THE WATERS OF THE MONTREAL LOWLANDS, QUEBEC
T2  - BULLETIN FRANCAIS DE LA PECHE ET DE LA PISCICULTURE
LA  - French
AB  - Introduced into North America in 1883, brown trout (Salmo trutta) was planted for the first time in Quebec in 1890.  However, it is only at the beginning of the 1950s that this species began to arise interest among Quebec wildlife managers, biologists and fishermen on account, comparatively to native charrs (Salvelinus spp), of its greater tolerance for rather high temperatures and interspecific competition.  In 1965, the discovery of this species in the lowlands of the Montreal area, considered of poor interest for salmonids, has been the starting-point of a sustained planting program in the Saint-Laurent river and in the lower reaches of a certain number of its tributaries.  In spite of the relatively high summer temperatures (max. > 25-degrees-C) and the abundant and diversified fish fauna in these waters, the brown trout thrives successfully and grows rapidly.  Its sport fishing yield is satisfactory as to fishing success, size of specimen caught and amount of fish planted returned.  Spawning has been observed on many occasions.  However, the analysis of recent statistics derived from the catch of a group of devoted fishermen supports the hypothesis of a significant contribution of the plantings to the fishing harvest and, on the other hand, the possibility of an insignificant contribution by natural reproduction.  The planting possibilities of the brown trout are limited by measures aiming to protect the integrity of aquatic communities north of the 46-degrees N.  However, on account of the fact that this species, like many other non native salmonids, is already present in many basins like the Great Lakes, the Saint-Laurent river and several watercourses of many provinces and states of the Atlantic Cost, it seems likely that it will eventually establish itself in the Saint-Laurent estuary and Gulf tributaries, where it might interfere with the anadromous and fresh water populations of atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), brook charr (Salvelinus fontinalis) and arctic charr (Salvelinus salvelinus).

AB  - Both wild and hatchery Atlantic Salmon Salmo salar can contribute to restoration but can exhibit differences in spawning habitat selection (e.g., water depth, current speed) and egg nutritional quality (e.g., thiamine), which affect reproductive success. Hence, there is a need to be able to differentiate the spawning contribution of the two groups in the wild. As diets of wild and hatchery-reared spawners are markedly dissimilar and diet is known to influence stable isotope signature, egg stable isotope signatures offer the potential to discriminate redds of each. Using stable isotope analysis of carbon and nitrogen (C-13 and N-15) of naturally spawned Atlantic Salmon eggs, we were able to discriminate the redds of putative wild (i.e., previously stocked life stage feeding in Lake Ontario; EWSR) from putative hatchery-reared Atlantic Salmon (EHSR). Eggs of EWSR were significantly more enriched in nitrogen (N-15: 15.0 +/- 0.5 parts per thousand [mean +/- SE]) but more depleted in carbon (C-13: -26.6 +/- 0.3 parts per thousand) than eggs of EHSR (N-15 = 9.8 +/- 0.6 parts per thousand; C-13 = -17.5 +/- 0.0 parts per thousand). Eggs of EHSR were indistinguishable from eggs of known hatchery Atlantic Salmon for both C-13 and N-15. Using stable isotopes to discriminate redd type, few differences were found between the spawning habitat of putative wild and hatchery spawners. Similarly using the same criteria, thiamine levels in eggs of EWSR (8,474 +/- 840 pmol/g) were not significantly different from eggs of known wild Atlantic Salmon (3,691 +/- 782 pmol/g) or of eggs of EHSR (14,865 +/- 1,050 pmol/g), whose thiamine levels were indistinguishable from eggs of known hatchery Atlantic Salmon (14,200 +/- 1,167 pmol/g). Egg thiamine levels for all groups were above established mortality thresholds. Our results indicate that both hatchery and wild Atlantic Salmon can make reproductive contributions, which can be differentiated and quantified using stable isotope signatures.

AB  - Water level fluctuations in a drinking water reservoir (Saidenbach Reservoir, Saxony, Germany) and length-frequency data of roach (Rutilus rutilus) derived from gillnet catches were studied over a period of eight succeeding years and subsequently analysed with respect to level change and cohort establishment. The results indicate a strong impact of water level on the year class strength of roach. Constantly high water level with large areas of inundated plants led to a very strong roach year class. Conversely, decreasing water level shortly after the spawning period was found to result in a total loss of the new roach year class. Any other possible factors influencing year class strength of roach (such as food, temperature, winter duration) may only play a role if the water level after spawning remained relatively stable. Consequently, water quantity management in reservoirs can be used as a biomanipulation tool to reduce the planktivorous fish stock and to improve water quality, which should be an interesting option especially in drinking water reservoirs.

AB  - Several populations of arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus in southern Scotland have become extinct and Loch Doon is the only site left for the species in the southwest.  The catchment of the loch lies mainly on granite and much has recently been afforested.  Most of the inflowing streams are acid and the loch itself appears to have acidified over the last two decades.  Few acid-sensitive invertebrates occur in the streams or in the loch.  The fish populations of the most acid streams are low in density.
   Growth of arctic charr in the loch resembles that in some other Scottish lochs but appears to have increased in recent years.  The charr feed on benthic invertebrates for much of the year but on zooplankton in the summer.  Spawning occurs in early October, leaving the fish in poor condition which improves during the spring to reach a maximum in late summer, just prior to spawning.  Spawning takes place over gravel and stones in shallow water all round the loch.
   Angling data indicate that the average size of both trout and arctic charr in Loch Doon has increased significantly over the last 15 years.  Chemical and biological evidence suggests that Loch Doon is acidifying and that management is necessary if the stock of charr there is to be saved.

AB  - The coexistence of four morphs of arctic charr in Thingvallavatn, Iceland. was demonstrated by investigations of morphology, habitat use, diet, endoparasitic fauna, life history, time and place of spawning, early ontogeny, and population genetics. Head morphology in embryos, juveniles and adults revealed the presence of two charr morphotypes, each including two morphs: (1) a benthic morphotype including large benthivorous (LB-) and small benthivorous (SB-) charr, featuring overshot mouth and relatively large pectoral fins, and (2) a pelagic morphotype including planktivorous (PL-) and piscivorous (PI-) charr, featuring terminal mouth and relatively small pectoral fins. SB-charr mature sexually (50%) at 2 (males) and 4 yr (females); asymptotic length is 133 mm. LB-charr mature sexually at 8 yr; asymptotic length is 553 mm. PL-charr mature sexually at 4 (males) and 5 yr (females); asymptotic length is 205 mm. PI-charr mature sexually at 6 yr; asymptotic length is 302 mm. SB- and LB-charr both live in the littoral zone, but they segregate in microhabitat: LB-charr live epibenthically, whereas SB-charr live mainly in the interstitial spaces of the stony substrate. Their diet, however, is similar (Schoener's D = 0.34 - 0.89). Both feed mainly on the snail Lymnaea peregra. PI-charr live mainly epibenthically, feeding on sticklebacks and juvenile charr. PL-charr is the most numerous morph in the lake. It lives both in the pelagic and in the epibenthic zone, feeding on crustacean zooplankton and chironomid pupae. The young of the year of all morphs live in the littoral zone where they feed on chironomid larvae. All morphs spawn in the littoral zone, LB-charr spawn in July-August, PL- and PI-charr spawn in September-November, whereas SB-charr spawn during August to November. Genetically, the morphs are very similar; Nei's genetic distances were between 0.00004 to 0.00126. The only significant difference found was between SB-charr and the other three morphs combined. The four morphs are conspecifics, although they may be reproductively segregated to some extent.

AB  - Salmonid fishes, native to the northern hemisphere, have become naturalized in many austral countries and appear linked to the decline of native fishes, particularly galaxiids. However, a lack of baseline information and the potential for confounding anthropogenic stressors have led to uncertainty regarding the association between salmonid invasions and galaxiid declines, especially in lakes, as these have been much less studied than streams. We surveyed 25 lakes in the Aysen region of Chilean Patagonia, including both uninvaded and salmonid-invaded lakes. Abundance indices (AI) of Galaxias platei and salmonids (Salmo trutta and Oncorhynchus mykiss) were calculated using capture-per-unit-effort data from gillnets, minnow traps, and electrofishing. We also measured additional environmental variables, including deforestation, lake morphometrics, altitude, and hydrological position (i.e., lake order). An information-theoretic approach to explaining the AI of G. platei revealed that by far the strongest effect was a negative association with the AI of salmonids. Lake order was also important, and using structural equation modeling, we show that this is an indirect effect naturally constraining the salmonid invasion success in Patagonia. Supporting this conclusion, an analysis of an independent data set from 106 mountain lakes in western Canada showed that introduced salmonids are indeed less successful in low-order lakes. Reproductive failure due to insufficient spawning habitat and harsh environmental conditions could be the cause of these limits to salmonid success. The existence of this effect in Chilean Patagonia suggests that low-order lakes are likely to provide natural ecological refugia for G. platei. Finally, pristine, high-order lakes should be actively protected as these have become rare and irreplaceable unspoiled references of the most diverse, natural lake ecosystems in Patagonia.

AB  - Behavioural and electro-olfactogram (EOG) responses to synthetic F-prostaglandins (PGFs) were recorded in the three salmonids: brown trout Salmo trutta, lake whitefish Coregonus clupeaformis and rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss. Exposure to 10(-8) M PGF(2alpha). and 13, 14-dihydro-PGF(2alpha), increased swimming activity in individually exposed brown trout in a flow-through tank. Digging and nest probing behaviours were further observed in brown trout females exposed to PGF(2alpha). Lake whitefish exposed to 10(-8) M PGF(2alpha) and 15-keto-PGF(2alpha) also increased their locomotion. In rainbow trout, the absence of behavioural responses to PGFs correlates with a lack of olfactory sensitivity to these chemicals. PGFs triggered behavioural responses distinct from the feeding stimulant in brown trout. EOG measurements demonstrated that brown trout were most sensitive to PGF(2alpha), with a threshold concentration of 10(-11) M. Lake whitefish were most sensitive to both 15-keto-PGF(2alpha). and 13,14-dihydro-PGF(2alpha). Cross-adaptation and binary mixture experiments suggest that only one olfactory receptive mechanism is involved in PGFs detection. The behavioural and olfactory responses observed with exposure to PGF(2alpha) and its metabolites suggest these compounds function as reproductive pheromones in brown trout and lake whitefish.

AB  - Among the species in the family Salmonidae, those represented by the genera Salmo , Salvelinus , and Oncorhynchus (subfamily Salmoninae) are the most studied. Here, various aspects of phenotypic and life-history variation of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar L., brown trout Salmo trutta L., and Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus (L.) are reviewed. While many strategies and tactics are commonly used by these species, there are also differences in their ecology and population dynamics that result in a variety of interesting and diverse topics that are challenging for future research. Atlantic salmon display considerable phenotypic plasticity and variability in life-history characters ranging from fully freshwater resident forms, where females can mature at approximately 10 cm in length, to anadromous populations characterised by 3-5 sea-winter (5SW) salmon. Even within simple 1SW populations, 20 or more spawning life-history types can be identified. Juveniles in freshwater can use both fluvial and lacustrine habitats for rearing, and while most smolts migrate to sea during the spring, fall migrations occur in some populations. At sea, some salmon undertake extensive oceanic migrations while other populations stay within the geographical confines of areas such as the Baltic Sea. At the other extreme are those that reside in estuaries and return to freshwater to spawn after spending only a few months at sea. The review of information on the diversity of life-history forms is related to conservation aspects associated with Atlantic salmon populations and current trends in abundance and survival. Brown trout is indigenous to Europe, North Africa and western Asia, but was introduced into at least 24 countries outside Europe and now has a world-wide distribution. It exploits both fresh and salt waters for feeding and spawning (brackish), and populations are often partially migratory. One part of the population leaves and feeds elsewhere, while another part stays as residents. In large, complex systems, the species is polymorphic with different size morphs in the various parts of the habitat. Brown trout feed close to the surface and near shore, but large individuals may move far offshore. The species exhibits ontogenetic niche shifts partly related to size and partly to developmental rate. They switch when the amount of surplus energy available for growth becomes small with fast growers being younger and smaller fish than slow growers. Brown trout is an opportunistic carnivore, but individuals specialise at least temporarily on particular food items; insect larvae are important for the young in streams, while littoral epibenthos in lakes and fish are most important for large trout. The sexes differ in resource use and size. Females are more inclined than males to become migratory and feed in pelagic waters. Males exploit running water, near-shore and surface waters more than females. Therefore, females feed more on zooplankton and exhibit a more uniform phenotype than males. The Arctic charr is the northernmost freshwater fish on earth, with a circumpolar distribution in the Holarctic that matches the last glaciation. Recent mtDNA studies indicate that there are five phylogeographic lineages (Atlantic, Arctic, Bering, Siberian and Acadian) that may be of Pleistocene origin. Phenotypic expression and ecology are more variable in charr than in most fish. Weights at maturation range from 3 g to 12 kg. Population differences in morphology and coloration are large and can have some genetic basis. Charr live in streams
   at sea and in all habitats of oligotrophic lakes, including very deep areas. Ontogeneti
   The charr feed on all major prey types of streams, lakes and near-shore marine habitats, but has high niche flexibility in competition. Cannibalism is expressed in several cases, and can be important for developing and maintaining bimodal size distributions. Anadromy is found in the northern part of its range and involves about 40, but sometimes more days in the sea. All charr overwinter in freshwater. Partial migration is common, but the degree of anadromy varies greatly among populations. The food at sea includes zooplankton and pelagic fish, but also epibenthos. Polymorphism and sympatric morphs are much studied. As a prominent fish of glaciated lakes, charr is an important species for studying ecological speciation by the combination of field studies and experiments, particularly in the fields of morphometric heterochrony and comparative behaviour.

AB  - The abundance of Bull Trout Salvelinus confluentus in the Metolius River and Lake Billy Chinook, a hydroelectric reservoir, increased dramatically from 1998 to 2004, following implementation of restrictive fishery regulations. However, both adult Bull Trout and kokanee Oncorhynchus nerka (prey) populations have declined in more recent years. We investigated the relationships between Bull Trout spawner densities, emerging fry densities, and numbers of juveniles migrating into the reservoir to determine the potential role of juvenile production in this decline. We hypothesized that age-1 and older juvenile production is now limited by natal habitat capacity and that excess fry production is lost to density-dependent mortality. Bull trout redd densities in surveyed spawning reaches ranged from 14 to 39 redds/km during recent years. The estimated abundance of emerging Bull Trout fry in monitored spawning reaches has varied from about 1.0-2.5 million annually since 2005, while mean estimated densities of newly emerged fry varied from over 35/m(2) in Roaring Creek during 2005 to less than 1/m(2) in Jefferson Creek during 2009. Fry capture numbers from high versus low escapement broods at the Metolius River downstream trap varied by a factor of four, but capture of age-1 and age-2 juveniles did not differ substantially. These findings indicate natal Bull Trout habitats are seeded at spawner densities of 14 redds/km and higher. Fry in excess of natal habitat capacity are probably lost to density-dependent mortality factors. We estimate natural recruitment of age-1 and older Bull Trout into Lake Billy Chinook of at least 9 individuals/ha annually since 2001. Recent population bottlenecks limiting adult Bull Trout abundance occurred after juvenile recruits entered the lake and are probably related to prey availability.

AB  - Populations of stream-dwelling salmonids (e.g., salmon and trout) are generally believed to be regulated by strong density-dependent mortality acting on the age-0 life stage, which produces a dome-shaped stock-recruitment curve. Although this paradigm is based largely on data from anadromous species, it has been widely applied to stream-resident salmonids despite the fact that the processes limiting or regulating stream-resident populations remain poorly understood. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether stream channel morphology affects the availability of spawning habitat for California golden trout, and whether spawning habitat availability influences the production of age-0 trout and recruitment into the adult population.
   Wide stream reaches contained significantly more spawning habitat and a higher density of nests and age-0 trout than did narrow reaches. In contrast to the idea that salmonid populations are regulated by density-dependent mortality of age-0 fish, we found that the mortality of age-0 trout was largely density independent. In addition, over most of the range of observed fish densities, the density of a particular cohort was positively correlated between years for age-0, age-1, and age-2 trout. Therefore, our golden trout study population was limited by spawning habitat, with spawning habitat availability influencing the production of age-0 trout as well as recruitment into the adult population.
   Grazing by cattle has widened the study streams, and our current findings help to explain why stream sections subject to grazing had more spawning habitat and higher golden trout densities than ungrazed sections. individual growth rates of golden trout are apparently negatively density dependent, and these grazing-related increases in trout density have likely resulted in decreased growth rates. Our study demonstrates that it is only by gaining an understanding of how processes operate that we will be able to predict the effects of habitat alteration on populations.

AB  - Agriculture in Northern Ireland depends on grass-based production, but since 1980, expansion of output has been effectively constrained by production limits set by the European Union agricultural policy. Despite this, long-term monitoring over several decades has shown significant degradation of water quality in Lough Neagh, with persistent high biomass of blue-green algae. Similar long-term studies have revealed a marked decline in the freshwater survival of salmon in the nearby River Bush. These changes may be related and reflect the impact of farming on water quality and salmonid production. Regular sampling of the inflowing rivers to Lough Neagh has shown that continued increase in lake phosphorus concentration has been primarily due to an increase in the soluble reactive phosphorus loading from agricultural diffuse sources. Similar diffuse inputs of agriculturally derived nutrients to the River Bush, leading to increased plant growth together with the accumulation of fine sediment in salmon spawning redds, are considered to be important in the decline of freshwater survival of salmon from egg to smolt. The impact of farming practices on lakes and rivers is considered in relation to understanding of the complex and interacting factors that link land use to water quality.

AB  - Using the electrofishing database of the French National Agency for Water and Aquatic Environment (Onema), the time trends of 48 freshwater fish taxa at 590 sites monitored for at least 8 years from 1990 to 2009 were investigated. The results demonstrated that species richness increased steadily from the beginning of the monitoring period. This is congruent with the finding that the number of species displaying a significant increase in spatial distribution or abundance was greater than those showing a significant decrease. Some species, however, had declined both in occurrence and abundance, e.g. tench Tinca tinca, common bream Abramis brama, brown trout Salmo trutta and European eel Anguilla anguilla. The species showing the most spectacular colonization were non-native, e.g. topmouth gudgeon Pseudorasbora parva, wels catfish Silurus glanis and asp Aspius aspius. The time trends in population density were related to the maximal body size, habitat requirement, occurrence and abundance and the status (i.e. native or exotic) but not to the spawning temperature.

AB  - Anadromous Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus, migrate back to freshwater in late summer to spawn and/or overwinter. While seasonal movement patterns during the freshwater residency period are generally understood, specifics of the short temporal activity patterns remain poorly characterized. This study used temperature and accelerometer sensing telemetry to describe the diel activity patterns of 21 overwintering anadromous Arctic charr in a lake in southern Labrador, Canada. Tagged individuals displayed diurnal activity patterns throughout the overwinter residency period marked by greater activity during the day than at night and distinctive peaks of activity at the beginning and the end of each daylight period. Diurnal patterns were interpreted as driven by prey and light availability in the upper water column because of known linkages between light and foraging efficiency. Movement activity also increased as a function of temperature during the spawning and ice breakup periods, but not during winter when increased movement activity was correlated with colder temperatures. No association was found between movement activity and body size over the size range (36.0-48.5 cm) of fish studied. Our data suggest a complex set of behavioural determinants of overwinter activity, among which temperature and foraging are the most significant.

AB  - We measured microhabitat characteristics, hatching and emergence success of brook charr, Salvelinus fontinalis, in a series of sites selected and not selected by individuals spawning in an artificially enhanced lake outlet. Differences between the physico-chemistry of surface and interstitial water were small and did not suggest the presence of groundwater seepage. The mean surface water velocity was significantly higher in selected than non-selected sites during the incubation and emergence periods. Differences in interstitial water flow were not detected. Overall, selected substrate was coarser and contained a lower proportion of fine particles than non-selected substrate, as determined by the geometric mean diameter of particles, the proportion of fine particles (<1 mm), and the Fredle index. The proportion of fine particles was correlated with sediment loading in incubators. A two-way ANOVA showed no significant effect of sites (selected versus non-selected) but did show a significant effect of the incubation substrate (Astro-turf(TM), selected substrate, non-selected substrate) on both the hatching and emergence success; the percentages of hatching and emergence were significantly higher in Astro-turf(TM) than in non-selected substrate, with selected substrate being intermediate. The results of this study suggest that redd site selection by brook chart is based on surface water velocity and substrate characteristics (granulometry and proportion of fine particles) that in turn affect egg survival. It is possible that the lower proportion of fine particles in selected sites (and incubators) is related to their higher water velocity, which could carry away fine particles that reduce the availability of oxygenated water to the embryos. In the same way, higher water velocity could act as a proximate cue in the absence of groundwater seepage or interstitial water flow for individuals to select suitable sites for spawning and egg incubation.

AB  - Background: Lake (sic)ingvallavatn in Iceland, a part of the river Olfusa drainage basin, was presumably populated by brown trout soon after it formed at the end of the last Ice Age. The genetic relatedness of the brown trout in (sic)ingvallavatn to other populations in the Olfusa drainage basin is unknown. After the building of a dam at the outlet of the lake in 1959 brown trout catches declined, though numbers have now increased. The aim of this study was to assess effects of geographic isolation and potential downstream gene flow on the genetic structure and diversity in brown trout sampled in several locations in the western side of the watershed of River Olfusa. We hypothesized that brown trout in Lake (sic)ingvallavatn constituted several local spawning populations connected by occasional gene flow before the damming of the lake. We also estimated the effective population size (NE) of some of these populations and tested for signs of a recent population bottleneck in Lake (sic)ingvallavatn.
   Methods: We sampled brown trout inhabiting four lakes and 12 rivers within and near the watershed of River Olfusa by means of electro- and net- fishing. After stringent data filtering, 2,597 polymorphic loci obtained from ddRADseq data from 317 individuals were ascertained as putative neutral markers.
   Results: Overall, the genetic relatedness of brown trout in the Olfusa watershed reflected the connectivity and topography of the waterways. Ancestry proportion analyses and a phylogenetic tree revealed seven distinct clusters, some of which corresponded to small populations with reduced genetic diversity. There was no evidence of downstream gene flow from Lake (sic)ingvallavatn, although gene flow was observed from much smaller mountain populations. Most locations showed low NE values (i.e., similar to 14.6 on average) while the putative anadromous trout from River Sog and the spawning population from River Oxara, that flows into Lake (sic)ingvallavatn, showed notably higher NE values (i.e., 71.2 and 56.5, respectively). No signals of recent population bottlenecks were detected in the brown trout of Lake (sic)ingvallavatn.
   Discussion: This is the first time that the genetic structure and diversity of brown trout in the watershed of River Olfusa have been assessed. Our results point towards the presence of a metapopulation in the watershed of Lake THORNingvallavatn, which has

AB  - The stocking of hatchery-origin fish into rivers and lakes has long been used in fisheries management to try to enhance catches, especially for trout and salmon species. Frequently, however, the long-term impacts of stocking programmes have not been evaluated. In this study, the authors investigate the contribution of a stocking programme undertaken to support the rod catch of sea trout in the Shetland Islands, UK. Once a highly productive recreational fishery, Shetland sea trout catches crashed in the mid-1990s. Around the time that stocking began, increases in rod catches were also reported, with advocates of the stocking highlighting the apparent success of the programme. Using a suite of genetic markers (microsatellites), this study explores the contribution of the stocking programme to the Shetland sea trout population. The authors found that the domesticated broodstock and wild spawned brown trout from seven streams were genetically distinct. Despite extensive stocking, wild spawned brown trout dominated, even in those streams with a long history of supplementation. The majority of sea trout caught and analysed were of wild origin - only a single individual was of pure stocked origin, with a small number of fish being of wild x stocked origins. This study suggests that stocking with a domesticated strain of brown trout has made only a very limited contribution to the Shetland Islands rod catch, and that the revival of sea trout numbers appears to be driven almost exclusively by recovery of trout spawned in the wild.

AB  - Salmonid (Salmonidae) sympatric diversity is the co-occurrence, in a lake or river, of two or more reproductively isolated populations/subpopulations, or phenotypes resulting from phenotypic plasticity. Sympatric populations can arise through allopatric and/or sympatric evolution. Subsequently, allopatric lineages can occur in sympatry due to independent colonisation and/or through anthropogenic introduction. Sympatric divergence is often driven by feeding opportunities, with populations segregating as planktivorous, benthivorous and piscivorous ecotypes ("trophic polymorphism"), and further segregation occurring by feeding depth and body size. Subpopulations evolve by natal homing where a water has two or more discrete spawning areas, often resulting in phenotypically and ecologically cryptic sympatry. Most known sympatric populations/phenotypes in trout of the genus Salmo (Eurasian trout aka brown trout) involve sympatric piscivorous (ferox) and lifetime invertivorous trout. Segregation on the benthic-limnetic axis has been poorly studied in Eurasian trout compared with other salmonids but is likely commoner than currently described. While three sympatric populations/species of Eurasian trout are recognised from Lake Ohrid (Albania/North Macedonia), limited ecological information is available and there are only two lakes with three or four sympatric populations with described benthic, limnetic and piscivorous trophic segregation: Lough Melvin (Ireland) and Loch Laidon (Scotland), the latter having the only identified case of a sympatric profundal benthic feeding populations, possibly due to the absence of Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) in the lake. Many thousands of waters are yet to be examined. Some sympatric populations are extinct, and others are vulnerable with conservation action being urgently required. This should ideally be based on populations/conservation units, but the lack of recognition of intraspecific units in most legislations in the native Eurasian trout range necessitates a pragmatic approach, with species classification, where appropriate, based on integrative taxonomy. Some sympatric populations clearly merit species status and should be formally classified as such if a valid previous name is not available.

AB  - Maturing lake trout (Salmo trutta lacustris) of both sexes were exposed to 10 and 20 mu g/liter phytosterols, mainly beta-sitosterol, for 4.5 months prior to spawning. Eggs from preexposed females were artificially fertilized with milt from preexposed males in clean water, whereupon the eggs were incubated in clean,vater until hatching. Yolk sac fry were followed until swim-up, and mortality as well as deformities was recorded. The physiological status of the parent fish was documented, as was the occurrence of phytosterols in bile liquid and gonads. In addition, eggs from preexposed females were fertilized with milt from unexposed males to evaluate the existence of possible sex-linked differences. The results indicate a markedly increased dose-dependent egg mortality, smaller egg size, and lower mean weight of the the yolk sac stage larvae, There was a higher prevalence of deformed or otherwise diseased larvae, especially at the higher dose, but also in the groups where unexposed males were used for fertilization, indicating a female-linked effect mechanism. A causal link between effects on eggs and brood was obtained through a dose-dependent increase in physiological in the roe, Several physiological parameters (higher plasma estradiol, higher 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase activity) implied slower maturation of the exposed female fish, whereas indications of accelerated maturation were obtained for the male fish from the same groups. The results indicate that naturally occurring wood-derived compounds in pulp mill effluents may be responsible for reproductive impacts previously observed in fish both in the laboratory and in the receiving waters of pulp mill effluents, The results also suggest that more attention should be paid to process streams emanating from the unbleached part of the mill.

AB  - Local adaptation is considered a paradigm in studies of salmonid fish populations. Yet, little is known about the geographical scale of local adaptation. Is adaptive divergence primarily evident at the scale of regions or individual populations? Also, many salmonid populations are subject to spawning intrusion by farmed conspecifics that experience selection regimes fundamentally different from wild populations. This prompts the question if adaptive differences between wild populations and hatchery strains are more pronounced than between different wild populations? We addressed these issues by analyzing variation at 74 microsatellite loci (including anonymous and expressed sequence tag- and quantitative trait locus-linked markers) in 15 anadromous wild brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) populations, representing five geographical regions, along with two lake populations and two hatchery strains used for stocking some of the populations. F-ST-based outlier tests revealed more outlier loci between different geographical regions separated by 522 228 km (mean +/- s.d.) than between populations within regions separated by 117 +/- 79 km (mean +/- s.d.). A significant association between geographical distance and number of outliers between regions was evident. There was no evidence for more outliers in comparisons involving hatchery trout, but the loci under putative selection generally were not the same as those found to be outliers between wild populations. Our study supports the notion of local adaption being increasingly important at the scale of regions as compared with individual populations, and suggests that loci involved in adaptation to captive environments are not necessarily the same as those involved in adaptive divergence among wild populations.

AB  - Effective management of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar requires accurate predictions of the numbers of smolts a spawning stock can produce and an understanding of species population dynamics. Because field population data are often lacking and are difficult and expensive to obtain, we propose a simulation modeling framework for analyzing Atlantic salmon smolt production dynamics. The model incorporates density-dependent mortality and the random environmental influences of temperature and precipitation to determine smolt abundance and growth patterns. A series of simulated growth-temperature relationships are developed for use in the model based on previous work completed for sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka and field observations on the range of temperatures over which Atlantic salmon feed. The model is described and used to examine the potential responses of Atlantic salmon stocks in New Brunswick, Quebec, and Labrador to changes in temperature, precipitation, and alevin density. Modeled changes in the climatic variables are similar to those suggested by climate change literature. Results suggest that temperature and alevin density have significant and largely independent effects on smolt output and parr densities.

AB  - Vendace and whitefish in Lake Osensjoen (boreal south-east Norway) were studied by means of gillnet test fishing (1976-2013) and hydro acoustic acquisition (1986-2011). Vendace increased in number between 1998 and 2009 while growth and size at maturity decreased. The relative density of whitefish decreased in the pelagic habitat, whereas growth and size remained the same. Both species exhibited varying year-class strength. Whereas strong year-classes of both species became less frequent after 1980 than before this, this seemed to change after 2000, especially for vendace. Generalised additive models suggested a strong positive relationship between July/August mean air temperature and year-class strength of both vendace and whitefish. Whitefish recruitment was also negatively affected by the new regulation regime implemented since 1981, and positively correlated with water level after hatching and by late ice off. The reason for the diverging impacts of environmental factors on the two species may be that vendace spawn in deeper waters that whitefish do. The results indicate that increasing summer temperatures benefit recruitment of both species, whereas low water level and early ice off will harm whitefish recruitment. Both trends are caused by climate warming. It may be speculated that increased density of the specialised plankton feeding vendace may affect the algal community through increased predation on herbivorous zooplankton and potentially affect the trophic state of the lake.

AB  - Intraspecific genetic variation can have similar effects as species diversity on ecosystem function; understanding such variation is important, particularly for ecological key species. The brown trout plays central roles in many northern freshwater ecosystems, and several cases of sympatric brown trout populations have been detected in freshwater lakes based on apparent morphological differences. In some rare cases, sympatric, genetically distinct populations lacking visible phenotypic differences have been detected based on genetic data alone. Detecting such "cryptic" sympatric populations without prior grouping of individuals based on phenotypic characteristics is more difficult statistically, though. The aim of the present study is to delineate the spatial connectivity of two cryptic, sympatric genetic clusters of brown trout discovered in two interconnected, tiny subarctic Swedish lakes. The structures were detected using allozyme markers, and have been monitored over time. Here, we confirm their existence for almost three decades and report that these cryptic, sympatric populations exhibit very different connectivity patterns to brown trout of nearby lakes. One of the clusters is relatively isolated while the other one shows high genetic similarity to downstream populations. There are indications of different spawning sites as reflected in genetic structuring among parr from different creeks. We used > 3000 SNPs on a subsample and find that the SNPs largely confirm the allozyme pattern but give considerably lower F (ST) values, and potentially indicate further structuring within populations. This type of complex genetic substructuring over microgeographical scales might be more common than anticipated and needs to be considered in conservation management.

AB  - Galaxias maculatus (Jenyns, 1842), is a gourmet fish of great commercial importance with overexploited fisheries. So, studies of its biology are essential in order to develop a technology for its cultivation (galaxiculture), which is at a pilot stage. The goals of this work are: 1) to provide a synthesis of the literature information on the biology of the species, and 2) to identify the lack of scientific knowledge and critical points for the development of a technology for mass commercial culture. G. maculatus is a small carnivorous fish with euryhaline populations differentiated between diadromic and freshwater. Diadromic populations spawn in the estuaries, and then the larvae migrates to the sea, returning aged 6 months and metamorphosing into adults. Studies of their systematic, populations and larvae stage in Chilean waters are scarce, but studies on feeding, reproduction and diseases are more numerous. One year old females lay about 1,200 adhesive eggs and an important number of them die after the first spawning (40%). G. maculatus has rapid growth (1.1% day(-1)) and a high metabolism, with an average life of 2 years. They can be cultivated in captivity, spawn and incubate their eggs to obtain larvae; adults eat salmon starter pellets and grow in tanks. The ciliate protozoa Ichtyophthirius multifilis (ich) produces high mortality in larvae and adults in confinement; mortality can be controlled with salt bath. The problems to be solved by research for future commercial fish farming are: recognising and selecting suitable populations for cultivation; increasing the number of eggs spawned by females; develop suitable diets for larvae and broodstock; and controlling ectoparasitic diseases. The critical point is achieving mass production by improving the techniques of reproduction and larviculture.

AB  - Natural and anthropogenic sources of sedimentation have the potential to degrade spawning habitat and negatively affect incubating fish embryos. Walleye Sander vitreus are lithophilic broadcast spawners that use specific spawning habitats that are vulnerable to degradation caused by deposition of suspended sediments. We measured the effect of different types of sediment cover on hatching success of Walleye eggs and assessed whether differences in female Walleye (female length and mean egg size) account for tolerance to sediment cover. Experiments were carried out in 2018 to test the effect of sediment cover on hatching success and in 2019 to test how female identity and female length or mean egg size may interact with sediment cover to influence hatching success. Eggs in both experiments were exposed to instantaneous sediment cover (0-7 mm) of either sand or silt from fertilization until day 15 of incubation. Results indicated that Walleye eggs were sensitive to silt cover (71% mortality with 2 mm of silt cover) but not sand cover (47% mortality with 7 mm of sand cover). Hatching success differed significantly among individual females. Although there was an indication that hatching success was marginally negatively related to female length and positively related to mean egg size, sediment cover seemed to have similar effects on eggs, regardless of female length or egg size. Susceptibility of Walleye eggs to mortality caused by sediment cover further underscores the need to limit large-scale sediment loading and resuspension in aquatic systems.

AB  - Radio and acoustic telemetry have been used in 24 studies of freshwater fish in New Zealand. Although most native species are too small to carry these tags, studies using telemetry have been carried out on four of the larger species, i.e. lampreys (Geotria australis), shortfin and longfin eels (Anguilla australis and A. dieffenbachii) and giant kokopu (Galaxias argenteus). Among the introduced species, telemetry has been used to study movements of brown and rainbow trout (Salmo trutta and Oncorhynchus mykiss) in both rivers and lakes, chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), koi carp (Cyprinus carpio) and bullhead catfish (Ameiurus nebulosus). To date, studies have almost exclusively been of short-term movements and seasonal migrations. Study objectives range from measuring microhabitats and home ranges to determining the extent of seasonal spawning migrations. The advent of progressively smaller tags will provide increased opportunities to use this technology on a wider range of fish species. Management implications of several studies are presented. Although biotelemetry studies have not yet been used in New Zealand, there are considerable opportunities for using such technology to increase understanding of fish energetics and also stress associated with catch-and-release practices in recreational fishing.

AB  - Identification of ecologically mediated mechanisms that drive population dynamical changes in fish communities and polymorphic fish stocks such as those of whitefish, Coregonus lavaretus, requires data that are seldom available in freshwater systems. We assessed the stock of each morphologically distinguishable whitefish form (native lesser sparsely-rakered whitefish, native blue whitefish and stocked northern densely-rakered whitefish) in the Lake Oulujarvi during 1973-2014, and related temporal variations in population dynamics to environmental data and catch per unit of effort (CPUE) data on other species having fisheries significance. The results demonstrated a synchronous major decline in the abundance of the native whitefish forms and a decline in the length-at-age of all forms. During the study period, summer time water temperature increased and surface water phosphorous concentration decreased. Recruitment in all whitefish forms showed Ricker-type dependence on spawning stock biomass but little residual correlation with the environmental parameters. Cross-correlation analyses suggested that the re-establishment of pikeperch Sander lucioperca population affected negatively both the recruitment and biomass of whitefish but the exact effect mechanisms require further assessment. Our results exemplify that ecosystem-based fisheries management in inland waters must take into account both natural and human-induced environmental changes as well as stockings, and that knowledge-based inland fisheries management is inherently data-intensive.

AB  - All English populations of Arctic charr are found in the Lake District (northwest England). There are at least four races of charr in Windermere, the largest natural lake in England, with the north and south basins of the lake each containing two distinct races that spawn in autumn and spring respectively. Three methods have been used to estimate levels of the charr stocks ; namely gill-netting each November (1939-1991) for autumn spawners in the north basin, anglers' catches from both basins (1966-1991), echo-survey data from both basins (July 1989 - December 1991). An increase in gill-net catches from 1945 to 1965 was associated with a cull of larger pike, Esox lucius L. ; since 1965, catches have fluctuated around a high mean level. There was good, if not excellent, agreement between the anglers' catches and the gill-net catches. The ratio of anglers' catches in the north and south basins showed that catches have been relatively low in the south basin since 1984. Although there has also been an increase in brown trout, Salmo trutta L., taken by the charr anglers since 1984 in the south basin, this increase was not responsible for the lower charr catches. When estimates of fish densities with an echo sounder were restricted to fish > 20 cm and depths down to 20 m, this being roughly the stock available to charr anglers, there was good agreement between monthly estimates and anglers' catches, especially in the north basin. The echo-sounder data confirmed the higher numbers in the north basin, and lower numbers in winter in both basins. The three different methods therefore provided comparable data on the fluctuations in levels of charr stocks in Windermere. Possible reasons for these fluctuations are discussed briefly.

KW  - FRY MORTALITY

AB  - During recent decades several Baltic fish species have been affected by poor reproductive success. The sea-run Baltic salmon populations are affected by the M74 syndrome, an early life-stage mortality associated with low thiamine (vitamin B-1) concentrations in the offspring. In order to study whether sea-run brown trout with symptoms and mortalities similar to M74 also suffer from low thiamine concentrations, analyses of thiamine were performed. Also, tissues of Baltic cod were analyzed for their content of thiamine. This study confirms that Baltic salmon that are affected by M74 suffer from low thiamine levels and that the temporal onset of the development of M74 may be correlated to the thiamine concentration in the eyed egg. Also, thiamine concentrations of muscle and ovaries from females that produced offspring with M74 were significantly lower than those of females that produced healthy progeny, which indicates that M74 may be a maternally transmitted thiamine deficiency. Preliminary data from sea-run Baltic brown trout showed that yolk-sac fry with symptoms that resembled those of M74-lethargy, darkening of skin and 100% mortality-had low mean thiamine concentrations (0.14 nmol g(-1) in 1994 and 0.34 in 1998) compared with those of healthy progeny (4.4 nmol g(-1) in 1994 and 3.9 in 1998). This indicates that some family groups of Baltic brown trout may be affected by a reproduction disorder related to thiamine deficiency. In spawning Baltic cod, hepatic and ovarian thiamine concentrations showed great variance, with values ranging from 0.56 to 4.7, and 3.8 to 30 nmol g(-1), respectively. Whether Baltic cod also suffer from mortality associated with a thiamine deficiency is not known.

AB  - Movements of radio-tagged pike Esox lucius (L.), pikeperch Stizostedion lucioperca (L.) and outward migrating sea trout smolts Salmo trutta (L.) were studied in a shallow Danish reservoir to obtain information of predator-prey interactions between these species. Twenty pikeperch (55-74 cm) and 19 pike (52-72 cm) were tagged. Female pikeperch spent more time near the outlet sluice during the smolt run (May) than at other times of the year, apparently actively hunting the smolts delayed in this area. In contrast, male pikeperch did not seem to participate in the smolt predation but remained stationary during the smolt run, presumably guarding their nests. Most tagged pike were present at the spawning grounds during the peak of the smolt run, where they had little chance of smolt encounter. Twenty migrating trout smolts were radio-tagged in the river upstream of the reservoir. Ten of these were located in the vicinity of the outlet sluice at least once, but were unwilling or unable to find and enter the sub-surface outlet sluice. Only one tagged smolt left the reservoir. After 1-12 days in the reservoir, the remaining smolts were eaten by pikeperch or pike and the results indicate that female pikeperch and few female pike have adjusted their behaviour to predation on smolts during the smolt run. The smolt predation in this man-made reservoir is higher than in natural lakes, probably due to the changed physical environment and introduced predators, such as pikeperch. The outlet sluice practice and the temporal overlap between smolt run and predator-spawning may be key factors in smolt survival. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Many west coastal and northern Norwegian rivers run through deep, confined valleys with permeable layers of glacial and alluvial deposits. Groundwater flows through these permeable layers and enter lakes and rivers as underwater seepage and springs. Groundwater inflow to inland Norwegian rivers may constitute 40-100% of total water discharge during low flow periods in late summer and winter. Juvenile salmonids may take advantage of groundwater upwellings and actively seek out such patches. In regulated rivers groundwater influx may create refuges during low flow or hydropeaking episodes. The importance of groundwater for salmon redd site selection and egg survival is also clear, although less known and documented in regulated rivers.
   Eggs of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) are deposited in redds in river bed gravels lacking fine sediments and with high oxygen levels. Egg development is therefore dependent on the interaction of a number of environmental factors such as groundwater influx, oxygen and temperature. Atlantic salmon in the regulated River Suldalslagen, Western Norway, spawn relatively late compared to other Norwegian rivers, with a peak in early January. Newly emerged fry are found from the end of May to the beginning of June, i.e. "swim up" one month earlier than expected using models for egg and alevin development and river water temperatures. The most plausible explanation is that groundwater has a higher and more stable temperature than surface river water. In field experiments, fertilized salmon eggs were placed in boxes close to natural spawning redds in the river bed at sites influenced and those not influenced by groundwater. A difference of up to 40 days in 50% hatching was found, and "swim up" occurred at the end of May in boxes influenced by groundwater.
   Preliminary studies have revealed that groundwater also plays an important role in survival of salmon eggs in the River Suldalslagen when dewatered in winter. Eggs placed in boxes in groundwater seepage areas during winter in the dewatered river bed survived even when covered by ice and snow. The survival from fertilization until 30 April, one month before hatching, was 91%, the same survival as found for eggs placed in boxes in the wetted river bed. However, mortality from fertilization to hatching was higher compared to the eggs placed in wetted river bed, 57 and 91% respectively.
   Groundwater creates a horizontal and vertical mosaic of temperatures in spawning redd areas leading to potentially greater variation in spawning sites, time of hatching and "swim up". This is likely to increase egg survival during low flow periods in regulated rivers. In conclusion, the interaction between groundwater and surface river water should therefore be considered when managing fish populations in regulated rivers. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - Stocking of non-native Salmoninae into North American waters began around 1870.  Brown trout (Salmo trutta) from Europe established populations across North America and is the only successful inter-continental introduction.  Introductions of native salmonids within North America but outside their native ranges have been common.  Ecological effects of salmonid introductions, include competition, predation on native salmonids and other fishes, environmental modification through digging of redds in stream bottom substrates during spawning, and introduction of parasites and disease to native fish.  Direct genetic effects from stocked salmonids are caused by interbreeding with native species.  Indirect genetic effects may result through selective forces and/or a reduction of effective population size, genetic drift, and inbreeding.  Management actions used to remove non-native salmonid populations include chemical reclamation and construction of barriers to movement.  Salmonid stocking as a management practice is appropriate for species or population rehabilitation.  Continued stocking of non-native salmonids should cease where viable native salmonid populations exist.  New introductions of Eurasian species should not be made because effects are unpredictable.  Aquaculture and the creation of transgenic fish pose special threats to North American salmonids.  The era of widespread, intentional introductions of salmonids by man justifiably is drawing to a close.

AB  - The objective of this study was to predict interannual fluctuations in the emergence period of sea trout fry, using models developed from field data for 70 excavated redds, and laboratory data on egg and alevin development at 30 constant temperatures (range 1.5-10.5 degrees C with 100 naturally fertilized eggs at each temperature). Egg weight and numbers per redd both increased with female length, a power function described the relationship. Early spawners were the largest females laying the largest and most numerous eggs, whilst late spawners were the smallest females laying the smallest and least numerous eggs; middle spawners being intermediate between these two extremes. Mean values for egg weight and numbers of eggs per redd were obtained for these three groups. Hatching and emergence times in the laboratory decreased with increasing temperature. Of five models tested for hatching time, the best fit was provided by a three-parameter hyperbolic model which formed the basis of the individual-based model used to predict egg hatching and fry emergence. Model development was described in detail and the final equations predicted the times taken for 5, 50 and 95% of the fry to emerge, and hence the period over which 90% of the fry emerged. Analogous models were obtained for egg hatching. All models were excellent fits to the laboratory data. Hatching times for eggs kept in perforated boxes in the stream were almost identical to those kept at similar mean temperatures in the laboratory. Model predictions of fry emergence times were validated by field data for 8 years (1967-1971, 1974, 1975, 1980). The chief objective was therefore fulfilled, and predictions for the 30-year study (1967-1996) revealed a large variation in the timing of emergence (extremes: 11 March-4 April 1989, 15-20 May 1979). Most of the variation in median emergence date was due to variations in water temperature, with spawning dates as a secondary factor; the latter, however, had a greater effect on the length of the emergence period.

AB  - Factors such as gamete quality can profoundly affect fertility, but the spawning micro-environment that surrounds the spermatozoa and eggs during gamete contact has largely been neglected. In fishes, understanding these gametic interactions is crucial because each female creates a unique spawning environment by simultaneously expelling her distinct ovarian fluid (OF) along with an egg batch. In turn, OF has been shown to influence spermatozoa performance traits by modifying spermatozoa behaviors and fertilization outcomes. Here, we shed light on these gametic interactions by overviewing literature on OF and how it impacts spermatozoa performance traits. Fish OF is clear or has slight coloration and can constitute <= 10-30% of egg mass. Viscosity of the OF is similar to 2- to 3-fold higher than water and its pH ranges 6.2 to 8.8. Osmolality of the OF is lower in freshwater (190-322 mOsmol/kg) than marine species (289-514 mOsmol/kg). Na+ (98.3-213.7 mmol/L) and Cl- (89.8-172.7 mmol/L) are predominant ions in OF, while K+ (1.7-19.3 mmol/L), Mg2+ (0.4-8.1 mmol/L), and Ca2+ (0.5-9.7 mmol/L) ions are detected at lower concentrations. Protein levels can be high in OF and exhibit intra- and inter-species variation (54-826 mg/100 mL). Fish OF also contains a series of organic components and substances that enhance and/or attract sperm towards the vicinity of an egg. OF can also differentially impact sperm based on genetic relatedness of mates, male phenotype (i.e. alternative reproductive tactics), or geographic origin. To conclude, when testing further reproductive paradigms, we suggest a shift from classic spermatozoa activation medium (water only) to more natural spawning media, which encompass OF-spermatozoa interactions.

AB  - Local adaptation and its underlying molecular basis has long been a key focus in evolutionary biology. There has recently been increased interest in the evolutionary role of plasticity and the molecular mechanisms underlying local adaptation. Using transcriptome analysis, we assessed differences in gene expression profiles for three brown trout (Salmo trutta) populations, one resident and two anadromous, experiencing different temperature regimes in the wild. The study was based on an F2 generation raised in a common garden setting. A previous study of the F1 generation revealed different reaction norms and significantly higher Q(ST) than F-ST among populations for two early life-history traits. In the present study we investigated if genomic reaction norm patterns were also present at the transcriptome level. Eggs from the three populations were incubated at two temperatures (5 and 8 degrees C) representing conditions encountered in the local environments. Global gene expression for fry at the stage of first feeding was analysed using a 32k cDNA microarray. The results revealed differences in gene expression between populations and temperatures and population x temperature interactions, the latter indicating locally adapted reaction norms. Moreover, the reaction norms paralleled those observed previously at early life-history traits. We identified 90 cDNA clones among the genes with an interaction effect that were differently expressed between the ecologically divergent populations. These included genes involved in immune-and stress response. We observed less plasticity in the resident as compared to the anadromous populations, possibly reflecting that the degree of environmental heterogeneity encountered by individuals throughout their life cycle will select for variable level of phenotypic plasticity at the transcriptome level. Our study demonstrates the usefulness of transcriptome approaches to identify genes with different temperature reaction norms. The responses observed suggest that populations may vary in their susceptibility to climate change.

AB  - Seasonal growth patterns have been investigated in juveniles of two reproductively isolated Arctic charr [Salvelinus alpinus (L.)] morphs, which coexist in distinct ecological niches (upper-water and deep-water environments) in a subarctic lake. Offspring (F1-generation) of each of the littoral spawning charr (LO) and the profundal spawning charr (PB) were reared individually over a period of 12 months under simulated natural photoperiod (at 69A degrees N) and two different temperature regimes to mimic the profundal zone conditions with constantly low temperature (similar to 4 A degrees C) and the littoral zone conditions with seasonally cycling temperatures. All charr increased in weight during the experimental period. The LO-morph performed generally best at naturally fluctuating temperature, whereas the PB-morph grew best at a constantly low temperature (4 A degrees C). The LO-morph showed a typical seasonal growth pattern found earlier for anadromous Arctic charr, with elevated specific growth rates (SGR) during June-October and profoundly reduced or negative SGR-values during November-February suggesting that the fish ceased feeding during this period. In contrast, the PB-morph maintained a steady growth rate, regardless of temperature regime, and showed less signs of reduced appetite during the polar night period and exhibited significantly higher SGR-values during late autumn and early winter compared to the LO-morph. This study suggests different heritable adaptations in somatic growth trajectories where the deep-water PB-morph do not show a down-regulation of appetite and voluntary fasting during winter conditions with typically low light intensity and low temperatures, and up-regulation of appetite with hyperphagia during summer, as characteristically found for the upper-water LO-morph and anadromous Arctic charr.

AB  - Large sand bed loads in trout stream headwaters can limit salmonid spawning habitat and reproductive success. This phenomenon has been observed in many northern Wisconsin watersheds, where historic logging practices are the likely source of the sediment loading. Presently, sediment transport is limited by abundant woody debris, causing channels to aggrade and bury gravels. We evaluated the impacts of a wood debris and beaver dam removal remediation strategy on fine sediment transport and exposure of the underlying gravel and cobble substrates in a second-order Lake Superior tributary. A 300-m treatment reach received selective wood removals and was compared with both an upstream 300-m reference reach receiving no alteration and a downstream reach to monitor the effects of transferred fine sediment. Physical channel measurements were taken before the wood removal process, with repeat sampling at 10 and 12 months posttreatment. The wood removal treatment resulted in a significant 25% narrowing of mean stream widths, a 32% increase in mean flow velocities, a 58% reduction in the sand bed load, and a 400% increase in the available coarse substrate across the channel. Grain size distributions coarsened noticeably from pre-to posttreatment. Water depth and temperature were not altered by the treatment, and the reference station physical measures were relatively unchanged over the 12-month study period. Immediately after the wood removal there was an observable pulse of sediment traveling through the downstream reach that increased the sand bed load, increased stream widths, and filled pools. However, these impacts diminished with time, and near-preremoval conditions had returned after 12 months. The wood removal treatment caused a significant reduction in sand content and enhanced the availability of salmonid spawning substrates.

AB  - Many populations of anadromous herring, (e.g., alewives Alosa pseudoharengus and blueback herring A. aestivalis, collectively referred to as river herring) are in decline. To help understand the various processes influencing their relative abundance, we studied juvenile river herring populations in ii small, coastal Massachusetts systems. We examined diel and seasonal movements, variation in patterns of abundance, and relationships between juvenile river herring numbers and seven abiotic and biotic factors (stream discharge, pond temperature, habitat availability, pond transparency, pH, food availability, and spawning stock size). Seasonally, juvenile downstream migration peaked in early summer, and most juvenile river herring emigrated between 1200 and 1600 hours. Little or no emigration occurred in late summer when stream channels were often dewatered, although several streams experienced a smaller, more variable emigration peak in the fall. In univariate regressions, stream discharge, pond volume, surface area, depth, transparency, and pH were significantly related to variation in juvenile abundance across systems. Multiple regression models that integrated discharge, volume, and transparency, as well as multivariate models that included abiotic and biotic influences, trophic effects, and system size, explained 32-82% of the variability in juvenile abundance across systems. Thus, stream discharge, pond volume, transparency, pH, trophic effects, and system size contribute to heterogeneity across systems and may influence the abundance of these fish during freshwater residence. Increased understanding of the sources of heterogeneity in movement patterns and causes of variability in abundance across systems can help to implement more effective monitoring protocols, more informed land-use decisions. and improved management of river herring.

AB  - For many ectothermic animals, the acquisition, storage and depletion of lipids is integral to successfully coping with reduced metabolic rates and activity levels associated with cold, winter periods. In fish, lipids are crucial for overwinter survival and successful reproduction. The timing and magnitude of seasonal lipid storage should therefore vary predictably among fish with different thermal preferences and spawn times. Small- and large-bodied fish should also face different constraints associated with season that influence lipid cycling. However, much work to date has been species- and location-specific and a general conceptual model for the seasonal energy budgets of freshwater fish is lacking. Here, we conducted a comprehensive literature review of seasonal lipid levels in freshwater fishes. We predicted that warm and cool water species would be more likely to demonstrate peak lipid levels during warm months than cold water species, and expected a larger magnitude of annual lipid cycling in warm and cool water compared to cold water fish. We also expected dampened lipid cycling in larger fish due to their lower mass-specific metabolic rates. Observed patterns in the timing and magnitude of lipid storage contradicted our prediction because lipid cycling was widespread across species, despite thermal guild, with peak lipid levels commonly occurring during warmer months, even in cold water fish. For body size effects, larger bodied fish species had dampened seasonal lipid cycling, as predicted. We developed a conceptual framework describing how the 'scope' for variation in annual lipid cycling changes with body size both among and within species in order to guide future work. Together, our findings suggest that energy acquired during warm months is broadly important for overwinter survival and reproduction in fishes, and provide a new perspective on the differential constraints and physiological responses to seasonality among freshwater fish. Improving our understanding of these dynamics is especially pressing given that a changing global climate is anticipated to alter existing seasonal signals.

AB  - A growing number of studies have been investigating the influence of contemporary environmental factors on population genetic structure, but few have addressed the issue of spatial patterns in the variable intensity of factors influencing the extent of population structure, and particularly so in aquatic ecosystems. In this study, we document the landscape genetics of northern pike (Esox lucius), based on the analysis of nearly 3000 individuals from 40 sampling sites using 22 microsatellites along the Lake Ontario - St. Lawrence River system (750 km) that locally presents diverse degrees of interannual water level variation. Genetic structure was globally very weak (F-ST = 0.0208) but spatially variable with mean level of differentiation in the upstream section of the studied area being threefold higher (F-ST = 0.0297) than observed in the downstream sector (F-ST = 0.0100). Beside interannual water level fluctuation, 19 additional variables were considered and a multiple regression on distance matrices model (R-2 = 0.6397, P < 0.001) revealed that water masses (b = 0.3617, P < 0.001) and man-made dams (b = 0.4852, P < 0.005) reduced genetic connectivity. Local level of interannual water level stability was positively associated to the extent of genetic differentiation (b = 0.3499, P < 0.05). As water level variation impacts on yearly quality and localization of spawning habitats, our study illustrates how temporal variation in local habitat availability, caused by interannual water level fluctuations, may locally decrease population genetic structure by forcing fish to move over longer distances to find suitable habitat. This study thus represents one of the rare examples of how environmental fluctuations may influence spatial variation in the extent of population genetic structure within a given species.

AB  - 1. This study shows how a stock-recruitment model can be used to assess the effects of drought on fish survival, using data from a long-term study of a sea-trout population. Droughts were severest in the summers of 1976, 1983, 1984 (also severe spring drought) and 1995, and less severe in summer, but followed by autumn droughts in 1969, 1989 and 1993.
   2. The Ricker curvilinear model significantly fit (P < 0.01) the relationship between initial egg density and survivor density for: parr aged 0+ years sampled in late May or early June, and late August or early September; parr aged 1+ years sampled in late May or early June, and late August or early September; spawning females and their total egg production. These analyses provided strong evidence for density-dependent population regulation and also identified extreme outliers, all these being for year-classes affected by the summer droughts.
   3. The variable effects of the seven summer droughts were quantified by expressing the difference between each pair of observed and expected values as a percentage (with 95% CL) of the expected value predicted from the Ricker model. The 1969 drought continued with an autumn drought and reduced the density of 1 + parr (1968 year-class), but had no long-term effects on female or egg densities. The 1983, 1984 (plus spring drought) and 1989 droughts reduced 0+ (1983, 1984 and 1989 year-classes) and 1+ (1982, 1983 and 1988 year-classes) parr densities, and led to low densities of returning females and their eggs from the 1982, 1983, 1988 and 1989 year-classes. The 1976 summer drought, and 1993 summer and autumn droughts had little effect on parr densities, but in the long term produced low densities of returning females and their eggs from the 1975 and 1992 year-classes. The 1995 drought reduced 0+ (1995 year-class) and 1+ (1994 year-class) parr densities, but its long-term effects cannot be evaluated until more data are available.
   4. Reduced densities of returning females and their eggs were associated with 1+ parr being subjected to droughts; possible reasons for-this are discussed, including growth retardation.
