      <description>Learning R: where to startSwirl (https://swirlstats.com/)I really like the swirl package in R that has several modules available for learning and understanding how R works. It leads you by the hand through straight forward courses that are carried out through the R console. There are a number of additional courses available (see: https://github.com/swirldev/swirl_courses#swirl-courses). Adventr is another package that does a similar thing - interactive tutorials, but I have not used that one.</description>
