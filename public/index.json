Monitoring biodiversity characteristics at large scales and with adequate resolution requires considerable effort and resources. Overall, there is clearly a huge scope for European hunters, a special and often overlooked group of citizen scientist, to contribute even more to biodiversity monitoring, especially because of their presence across the entire European landscape.\r\n2. Using the Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) framework we reviewed the published and grey literature and contacted experts to provide a comprehensive overview of hunters’ contributions to biodiversity monitoring. We examined the methods used to collect data in hunter-based monitoring, the geographic and taxonomic extent of such contributions and the scientific output stemming from hunter-based monitoring data.\r\n3. Our study suggests that hunter-based monitoring is widely distributed across Europe and across taxa as 32 out of the 36 European countries included in our analysis involve hunters in the monitoring of at least one species group with ungulates and small game species groups which have the widest hunter-based monitoring coverage. We found that it is possible to infer characteristics on Genetic composition, Species population, Species traits and Community composition with data that are being routinely collected by hunters in at least some countries. The main types of data provided are hunting bags data, Biological samples including carcasses of shot animals and non-invasive samplings and observations for counts and indices.\r\n4. Hunters collect data on biodiversity in its key dimensions, collaborations between hunters and scientists are fruitful and should be considered a standard partnership for biodiversity conservation. To overcome the challenges in the use of hunters’ data, more rigorous protocols for sampling data should be implemented and improvements made in data integration methods.","tags":[],"title":"Hunters as citizen scientists: contributions to biodiversity monitoring in Europe","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Thomas NE Gray","Matthew J Grainger","Romica Grosu"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1580511600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580511600,"objectID":"f15b6c0ae2ef86ea7e2c995ae4a9c715","permalink":"/publication/using-the-value-of-information-to-improve-conservation-decision-making/","publishdate":"2020-02-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/using-the-value-of-information-to-improve-conservation-decision-making/","section":"publication","summary":"Conservationists need to present biological monitoring data to decision makers in a way which clearly represents uncertainty.

We estimated the density of tiger prey in the core of the landscape using the Random Encounter Model from camera‐trap data and used Monte Carlo simulation to prorogate uncertainty around our model parameter estimates. This suggests there is currently a low probability that the core area of the landscape supports sufficient prey for a population of 25 adult tigers and that significant prey recovery is thus required prior to any reintroduction into the landscape. The Random Encounter Model contains a number of assumptions and we stress our main purpose is to illustrate an approach to incorporating uncertainty into conservation decision‐making rather than providing robust estimation of current tiger prey densities in the Cardamom Rainforest Landscape.

No direct measure of human disturbance was available for our mainland sites; instead we used questionnaires (n= 690) to understand how far people travelled to visit the coast and then used this distance with human population densities in a buffer around each site as a proxy for human disturbance levels.\r\n\r\nResults: After controlling for the extent of their preferred habitat at each site (rocky shore) we found: (i) the closer each of the 19 sites was to the nearest offshore refuge the higher the density of Ruddy Turnstones and (ii) bird counts were stable at the two refuge sites, whereas, on average, counts declined at the 17 mainland sites. However, no relationship was found between Ruddy Turnstone counts from 17 mainland sites and human population densities within differing distances from each site (up to 10km).\r\n\r\nConclusions: Our work suggests that Ruddy Turnstones made greater use of relatively undisturbed areas (offshore refuges) than those subject to greater disturbance by humans (mainland sites). Although the use of refuges and mainland in our study area was not well known, observations from 11 radio-tagged Ruddy Turnstones suggest that individual birds did use both locations. In a broader context, our work concurs with other studies that highlight the need for refuges with limited or no human access.\r\n\r\n","tags":[],"title":"Offshore refuges support higher densities and show slower population declines of wintering Ruddy Turnstones Arenaria interpres","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cansu Kandemir","Christian Reynolds","Monika Verma","Matthew Grainger","Gavin Stewart","Simone Righi","Simone Piras","Marco Setti","Matteo Vittuari","Tom Quested"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1578870000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578870000,"objectID":"e77a35131a1f7478839b72c938e07096","permalink":"/publication/offshore-refuges/","publishdate":"2020-01-13T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/offshore-refuges/","section":"publication","summary":"Food waste is a complex phenomenon. Food gets wasted for a range of different reasons, which are affected by a range of factors: to give a few examples at the household level, how people shop, what they buy, how those items are packaged, the time devoted to foodrelated activities, skills and capabilities relating to cooking and food management in the home, and attitudes to food safety (Quested et al., 2013). Given this complexity, there are many challenges and questions that need answering for those wishing to prevent food from being wasted or estimating the quantity of food being wasted. Ideally, empirical data would be obtained, but this is currently lacking, mainly due to the monetary and time cost of obtaining such data. Therefore, system-based simulation methods and modelling approaches are being developed using currently available data, as they can incorporate these complexities and allow these challenging questions to be answered. Numerous methods have been used to infer the amount of food loss, waste or surplus.

Perhaps the most useful outputs of a systematic map are an interactive database of studies and their meta-data, along with visualisations of this database. Despite the rapid increase in systematic mapping as an evidence synthesis method, there is currently a lack of Open Source software for producing interactive visualisations of systematic map databases. In April 2018, as attendees at and coordinators of the first ever Evidence Synthesis Hackathon in Stockholm, we decided to address this issue by developing an R-based tool called EviAtlas, an Open Access (i.e. free to use) and Open Source (i.e. software code is freely accessible and reproducible) tool for producing interactive, attractive tables and figures that summarise the evidence base. Here, we present our tool which includes the ability to generate vital visualisations for systematic maps and reviews as follows: a complete data table; a spatially explicit geographical information system (Evidence Atlas); Heat Maps that cross-tabulate two or more variables and display the number of studies belonging to multiple categories; and standard descriptive plots showing the nature of the evidence base, for example the number of studies published per year or number of studies per country.

This information is especially important for species of global conservation concern that are susceptible to the effects of habitat loss and climate change. In this study, we used ecological niche modeling to assess the current and future geographic distributional potential of White-breasted Guineafowl (Agelastes meleagrides) (Vulnerable) across West Africa.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\nWe used primary occurrence data obtained from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility and national parks in Liberia and Sierra Leone, and two independent environmental datasets (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer normalized difference vegetation index at 250 m spatial resolution, and Worldclim climate data at 2.5′ spatial resolution for two representative concentration pathway emissions scenarios and 27 general circulation models for 2050) to build ecological niche models in Maxent.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nFrom the projections, White-breasted Guineafowl showed a broader potential distribution across the region compared to the current IUCN range estimate for the species. Suitable areas were concentrated in the Gola rainforests in northwestern Liberia and southeastern Sierra Leone, the Tai-Sapo corridor in southeastern Liberia and southwestern Côte d’Ivoire, and the Nimba Mountains in northern Liberia, southeastern Guinea, and northwestern Côte d’Ivoire. Future climate-driven projections anticipated minimal range shifts in response to climate change.\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nBy combining remotely sensed data and climatic data, our results suggest that forest cover, rather than climate is the major driver of the species’ current distribution. Thus, conservation efforts should prioritize forest protection and mitigation of other anthropogenic threats (e.g. hunting pressure) affecting the species.","tags":[],"title":"Using remotely sensed and climate data to predict the current and potential future geographic distribution of a bird at multiple scales: the case of Agelastes meleagrides, a western African forest endemic","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"\r\rCan we use association rules to identify co-occurring species?\rMachine learning has been occupying my thoughts recently as I am reading the book Machine Learning with R by Brett Lantz (https://www.amazon.com/dp/1782162143?tag=inspiredalgor-20). I am interested in making the algorithms described in the book useful for my work in applied conservation science.\nUnsurprisingly a lot of effort in machine-learning has been focused on increasing sales. One area where this has shown rapid growth is in grocery shops where loyalty cards have allowed data to be collected on our transactions. Using algorithms such as “Apriori” developed by Agrawal \u0026amp; Srikant in 1994, grocery shops can develop association rules which predict which products are most likely to be sold in combination. If you go to the shop and buy burgers then the chances are quite high that you will also buy burger buns to go with them. These rules allow the shops, for example, to provide offers on some products or to place certain products together on the shelves and thus encourage us to buy them more often.\nTransactions are lists of products that a person has purchased. As ecologists and conservation scientists we often deal with lists of species (products) that we have observed at different sites (purchased). Can we use these association rules algorithms to identify species that are typically co-occurring? So, if we are shopping for a rare species, can we use the association rules from large datasets to predict how likely we are to find it co-occurring with other more common species.\nUsing the Arules R package we can mine association rules from transactions data (see this blog for an example: http://r-statistics.co/Association-Mining-With-R.html). We need some data with a lot of species from many sites to be useful for this exploration. The Natura2000 species lists contains data on over 27,000 sites in both terrestrial and marine environments. Species lists for each site are updated yearly by each European Member State. The main focus is on bird species (76% of species records are of birds), but also includes some mammals, amphibians, fish, invertebrates and plants. Clearly, this data is used here as purely an example and one should not interpret that outcomes in any ecologically meaningful way. However, ecological data are often similar in structure to these Natura2000 data.\nTo get the data go to https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/natura-10 and download the csv file of the species data\nlibrary(arules) # allows us to mine association rules\rlibrary(arulesViz) # this is a companion package to allow more fancy visualisations from the outputs of arules\rlibrary(tidyverse) # for data manipulation\rlibrary(knitr) # for html tables\rlibrary(kableExtra)\r# load the data\rdat\u0026lt;-read.csv(choose.files(), header=TRUE, sep= \u0026quot;;\u0026quot;) # this allows you to navigate to the correct folder on your own computer\r# We only need the sitecode and species name columns from the data set to allow us to create \u0026quot;transaction\u0026quot; data\rdat %\u0026gt;% select(SITECODE, SPECIESNAME)-\u0026gt;dat\rdat\u0026lt;-as.data.frame(dat) dat\u0026lt;-dat[order(dat$SITECODE),]\rdat\u0026lt;-plyr::dlply(dat,\u0026quot;SITECODE\u0026quot;,c) # here we are creating a list of species for each sitecode\rdat\u0026lt;-lapply(dat, \u0026#39;[[\u0026#39;, \u0026quot;SPECIESNAME\u0026quot;) # and here we are stripping out only the species list from the full list of lists above\rT\u0026lt;-dat[-1] %\u0026gt;%\rhead(5)\rT %\u0026gt;% kable() %\u0026gt;%\rkable_styling()\r\r\r\r\r\r\rx\r\r\r\r\r\rAnthus campestris\r\r\r\rArtemisia pancicii\r\r\r\rLanius collurio\r\r\r\rPulsatilla grandis\r\r\r\rSylvia nisoria\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rx\r\r\r\r\r\rAnthus campestris\r\r\r\rAquila heliaca\r\r\r\rBarbastella barbastellus\r\r\r\rButeo lagopus\r\r\r\rCircus cyaneus\r\r\r\rDendrocopos medius\r\r\r\rDryocopus martius\r\r\r\rFalco vespertinus\r\r\r\rLanius collurio\r\r\r\rLanius excubitor\r\r\r\rSylvia nisoria\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rx\r\r\r\r\r\rLanius collurio\r\r\r\rSpermophilus citellus\r\r\r\rSylvia nisoria\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rx\r\r\r\r\r\rCastor fiber\r\r\r\rCiconia nigra\r\r\r\rCircus aeruginosus\r\r\r\rCircus cyaneus\r\r\r\rCoenagrion ornatum\r\r\r\rLanius collurio\r\r\r\rRhodeus amarus\r\r\r\rSaxicola rubetra\r\r\r\rUnio crassus\r\r\r\rVanellus vanellus\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rx\r\r\r\r\r\rBombina bombina\r\r\r\rCirsium brachycephalum\r\r\r\rLanius collurio\r\r\r\rPulsatilla grandis\r\r\r\rSpermophilus citellus\r\r\r\rSylvia nisoria\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rFor each site there is a list of species recorded in them.

The species are listed as being on the Left-hand side (lhs) or right-hand side (rhs), so for the first rule is that Tetrao urogallus is more frequently listed with Dryocopus martius. The strength of that rule is measured in three ways. First is “support” which is calculated as the number of species lists that contains both those species divided by the total number of species lists. Confidence is the number of species lists with both species divided by the total number of species lists containing species A (in this case Tetrao urogallus). Lift is measured as the confidence divided by the expected confidence which is the number of species lists with species B (in this case Dryocopus martius) divided by the total species list. The higher the lift the more probable that the two species will occur together. The lift measure is not directional so that the rule A-\u0026gt;B is equivalent to B-\u0026gt;A.\nSo lets have a look at some of the rules and highlight the most supported\nplot(rules)\rrules_conf \u0026lt;- sort (rules, by=\u0026quot;confidence\u0026quot;, decreasing=TRUE) # \u0026#39;high-confidence\u0026#39; rules.\rkable(inspect(head(rules_conf))) %\u0026gt;% kable_styling() \r## lhs rhs support confidence lift count\r## [1] {Botaurus stellaris, ## Philomachus pugnax, ## Tringa glareola} =\u0026gt; {Circus aeruginosus} 0.03036956 0.9764706 7.039088 664\r## [2] {Anas clypeata, ## Anas penelope, ## Anas platyrhynchos} =\u0026gt; {Anas crecca} 0.03242774 0.9712329 12.995738 709\r## [3] {Botaurus stellaris, ## Circus cyaneus} =\u0026gt; {Circus aeruginosus} 0.03503476 0.9708492 6.998565 766\r## [4] {Anas querquedula, ## Porzana porzana} =\u0026gt; {Circus aeruginosus} 0.03119283 0.9701280 6.993366 682\r## [5] {Circus cyaneus, ## Porzana porzana} =\u0026gt; {Circus aeruginosus} 0.03100988 0.9685714 6.982145 678\r## [6] {Botaurus stellaris, ## Grus grus} =\u0026gt; {Circus aeruginosus} 0.03425723 0.9677003 6.975865 749\r\r\r\r\r\rrules_lift \u0026lt;- sort (rules, by=\u0026quot;lift\u0026quot;, decreasing=TRUE)\rkable(inspect(head(rules_lift))) %\u0026gt;% kable_styling() \r## lhs rhs support confidence lift count\r## [1] {Cuculus canorus, ## Fringilla coelebs, ## Phylloscopus collybita} =\u0026gt; {Erithacus rubecula} 0.03160446 0.9465753 20.05419 691\r## [2] {Cuculus canorus, ## Erithacus rubecula, ## Sylvia atricapilla} =\u0026gt; {Fringilla coelebs} 0.03133004 0.9133333 20.00914 685\r## [3] {Fringilla coelebs, ## Phylloscopus collybita, ## Sylvia atricapilla} =\u0026gt; {Erithacus rubecula} 0.03261068 0.9418758 19.95463 713\r## [4] {Cuculus canorus, ## Fringilla coelebs, ## Sylvia atricapilla} =\u0026gt; {Erithacus rubecula} 0.03133004 0.9396433 19.90733 685\r## [5] {Fringilla coelebs, ## Phylloscopus collybita, ## Turdus philomelos} =\u0026gt; {Erithacus rubecula} 0.03018661 0.9388336 19.89017 660\r## [6] {Cuculus canorus, ## Erithacus rubecula, ## Phylloscopus collybita} =\u0026gt; {Fringilla coelebs} 0.03160446 0.9044503 19.81453 691\r\r\r\r\r\r##So, what do these measures of strength mean?\rA rule with a confidence of 1 implies that whenever we record the species on the left-hand side we also record the species on the right-hand side 100 % of the time. So for our top ranked rule for confidence when we record Botaurus stellaris, Philomachus pugnax and Tringa glareola we also record Circus aeruginosus 97% of the time.\nA rule with a lift of 20 implies that, the species on the left-hand side and right-hand side are 20 times more likely to be recorded together compared to the assumption of unrelatedness.\nSupport is a measure of the probability that species on the left-hand side are recorded with together with those on the right-hand side in the dataset analysed.\n\rBuying rare species\rThe apriori algorithm can be used to get rules for specific items. If you set the list to include only your focal species on the right-hand side you will get rules for species that it is listed with.

Value of Information (VoI) methods provide an approach for understanding and managing uncertainty from the standpoint of the decision maker. These methods are commonly used in other fields (e.g. economics, public health) and are increasingly used in biodiversity conservation. This decision‐analytical approach can identify the best management alternative to select where the effectiveness of interventions is uncertain, and can help to decide when to act and when to delay action until after further research. We review the use of VoI in the environmental domain, reflect on the need for greater uptake of VoI, particularly for strategic conservation planning, and suggest promising areas for new research. We also suggest common reporting standards as a means of increasing the leverage of this powerful tool. \r\nThe environmental science, ecology and biodiversity categories of the Web of Knowledge were searched using the terms ‘Value of Information,’ ‘Expected Value of Perfect Information,’ and the abbreviation ‘EVPI.’ Google Scholar was searched with the same terms, and additionally the terms decision and biology, biodiversity conservation, fish, or ecology. We identified 1225 papers from these searches. Included studies were limited to those that showed an application of VoI in biodiversity conservation rather than simply describing the method. All examples of use of VOI were summarised regarding the application of VoI, the management objectives, the uncertainties, the models used, how the objectives were measured, and the type of VoI.\r\nWhile the use of VoI appears to be on the increase in biodiversity conservation, the reporting of results is highly variable, which can make it difficult to understand the decision context and which uncertainties were considered. Moreover, it was unclear if, and how, the papers informed management and policy interventions, which is why we suggest a range of reporting standards that would aid the use of VoI. \r\nThe use of VoI in conservation settings is at an early stage. There are opportunities for broader applications, not only for species‐focussed management problems, but also for setting local or global research priorities for biodiversity conservation, making funding decisions, or designing or improving protected area networks and management. The long‐term benefits of applying VoI methods to biodiversity conservation include a more structured and decision‐focused allocation of resources to research.","tags":[],"title":"Using the Value of Information to improve conservation decision making","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matthew Grainger","Dusit Ngoprasert","Philip McGowan","Tommaso Savini"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1503007200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1503007200,"objectID":"8f2aa1afc1e105d4f57cc2b2a8897460","permalink":"/publication/informing-decisions-on-an-extremely-data-poor-species-facing-imminent-extinction/","publishdate":"2017-08-18T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/informing-decisions-on-an-extremely-data-poor-species-facing-imminent-extinction/","section":"publication","summary":"Some of the species that are believed to have the highest probability of extinction are also amongst the most poorly known, and this makes it extremely difficult to decide how to spend scarce resources. Assessments of conservation status made on the basis of loss or degradation of habitat and lack of records may provide compelling indications of a decline in geographical range and population size, but they do not help identify where conservation action might be best targeted. Methods for assessing the probability of extinction and for modelling species’ distributions exist, but their data requirements often exceed the information that is available for some of the most urgent conservation cases. Here we use all available information (localities, expert information, climate and landcover) about a high-priority Vietnamese bird species (Edwards's pheasant Lophura edwardsi) to assess objectively the probability of its persistence, and where surveys or other conservation action should be targeted. It is clear that the species is on the threshold of extinction and there is an urgent need to survey Bach Ma National Park (including the extension) and to consider surveying Ke Go Nature Reserve. This approach has potential to help identify where conservation action should be targeted for other Critically Endangered species for which there is an extreme scarcity of information.","tags":[],"title":"Informing decisions on an extremely data poor species facing imminent extinction","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.\n Slides can be added in a few ways:\n Create slides using Academic\u0026rsquo;s Slides feature and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Upload an existing slide deck to static/ and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Embed your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using shortcodes.
